A field study was conducted to investigate the effects of supplemental ultraviolet-B radiation
(280-320 nm) on the growth, biomass allocation and yield of two tropical cultivars (HD 2329 and
HUW 234) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at four different combinations of mineral nutrients (N, P
and K). Supplemental UV-B caused reductions in biomass, shoot length, root length, yield and harvest
index. Plants grown without fertilizers exhibited maximum inhibitory response. Plants grown under
additional nutrient dose were less affected at enhanced UV-B. The study suggests that use of 1.5 times
the recommended dose of N, P and K provided maximum protection against UV-B damage in both cultivars.
Cultivar HD 2329 was more responsive than cultivar HUW 234 to the additional dose of mineral
nutrients.
