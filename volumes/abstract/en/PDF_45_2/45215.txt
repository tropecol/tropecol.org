Vermicomposting of rice-straw using three species of earthworms viz., Perionyx excavatus
Perrier, Octochaetona phillotti (Michaelsen) and Octonochaeta rosea (Stephenson) was prepared.
Plant nutrient contents of these vermicomposts and their effects on sorghum growth in relation
to the effects of normal compost (without earthworms), that of chemical fertilizers (urea and single
super-phosphate applied @ 40 kg ha-1) and sole soil were investigated. Vermicompost produced by
the three species of earthworms differed in their nutrient concentrations, but possessed higher concentration
of total N and Ca than that of the normal compost. Vermicompost produced by P. excavatus
possessed higher concentrations of total N, available P and K and Ca and Na than the compost
produced by O. rosea. The growth of sorghum in the mixtures of 75% of vermicompost produced by P.
excavatus and 25% soil was significantly higher than that of the plants grown in mixtures of vermicompost
produced by O. phillotti and O. rosea and soil, normal compost, soil mixed with chemical fertilizers
and sole soil.
