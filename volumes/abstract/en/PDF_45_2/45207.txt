Variations in the density, composition and diversity of the benthic macroinvertebrates
were studied in the up and downstream sections of the impounded zones (Veerbhadra and Bhimgoda
barrage) of the river Ganga in the foothills. In these sections differences in the benthic density were
found to be insignificant (P<0.05). The sections differed in terms of composition and relative abundance
of different taxa. The regulated stretch was found to harbour only Ephemerotera, Diptera, Trichoptera
and Mollusca. Plecoterans were absent while Coleopterans were very rare in the regulated stretch as
compared with the upstream pristine stretch studied earlier. The predominance of Heptageniidae and
fragmented occurrence exhibited by other taxa are attributed to fluctuations in the flow regimes and
loss of substrate diversity. The diversity of benthic community was lower in upstream sections being
least in UVB (0.1348 – 1.1319). However, the differences were not significant. Similarity index indicated
lack of similarity in the community at impounded locations.
