The study was carried out to assess the impact of anthropogenic disturbances of mild intensity
on diversity and phytosociological attributes of tree species in two subtropical forest stands,
represented by Ialong and Raliang sacred groves in Jaintia hills of Meghalaya, northeast India. A total
of 159 woody species (= 5 cm dbh) of 107 genera was identified in the two groves spreading over an area
of 2 ha. The richness of woody species in 0.5 ha study plots increased from 80-82 in the protected stands
to 92-93 in the disturbed stands of the two groves. In case of Ialong sacred grove, their density decreased
from 1476 stems ha-1 in the protected stand to 1340 stems ha-1 in the disturbed stand whereas,
in the Raliang sacred grove, it increased from 938 stems ha-1 in the protected stand to 1308 stems ha-1
in the disturbed stand. The basal area was higher in the undisturbed stands (57 to 71 m2ha-1) than the
disturbed stands (36 to 49 m2h-1) in both the groves. Its distribution in different dbh classes resulted in
a J-shaped curve in all but one stand. On the contrary, distribution of both species richness as well as
their density in different dbh classes yielded a reverse J-shaped curve. Results revealed that the disturbance
of mild intensity, to which these forests were exposed, enhanced species richness without altering
tree population structure of the community.
