Rampara forest of Saurashtra region of Gujarat state of India was quantitatively analyzed.
The total tree basal cover ranged from 180 to 3326 cm2 100 m-2. The composition of tree and
shrub layers was markedly similar among various sites. Site 1 supported the largest shrub population,
while site 2 was the poorest in this regard. Site 1 on density basis and site 2 on cover and IVI basis had
maximum diversity of tree species. On the whole, the studied scrub forest has low species diversity.
Population structure of different species indicates Butea monosperma at sites 2 and 3, Prosopis cineraria
at site 2 and Boswellia serrata at sites 2 and 4 may disappear in near future. Cordia gharaf at site
1, Acacia catechu at sites 1, 2 and 4, Boswellia serrata and Bauhinia racemosa at site 3 are recent invaders
and may become canopy dominants later on.
