Fragmentation of habitat is one of the major reasons for altering the vegetal cover
across different scales. The present study aims to focus on the changes occurred in the overall vegetal
cover and floristic composition in and around Harni pond at Baroda due to the impact of anthropogenic
pressure over the past 45 years. It documents the existing vegetal cover and compares the shifts in the
density and diversity of plant species documented earlier. Vegetal cover in and around the pond was
monitored for a period of 2 years (2000-2002). The plants documented were compared with that of a
previous study carried out in 1957. The earlier study documented a total of 158 angiosperms of 48
families. In the present study, out of these 158 initially documented species, a total of 113 species belonging
to 46 families were relocated and a new documentation of 28 angiosperms belonging to 15 families
was made from the study area. A good number of plants with lesser density have undergone local
extinction and the population of commonly occurring plants has shown a reduction. Notable reason behind
the diversity decline is the high reduction in seed bank of pond area. Few species with larger densities
disappeared. The disappearance was more in species with low density. Some species maintained
similar numbers irrespective of habitat variation. Results are discussed in the light of habitat alteration
and vegetal cover variation.
