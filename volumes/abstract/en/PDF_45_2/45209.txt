Mallotus philippensis, a dioecious evergreen sub-dominant tree, grows as close associate
of sal within mixed natural forests as well as managed plantation forests of north-eastern U.P. A comparison
of its male and female populations at two contrasting light regimes depicts that sex-ratio of
Mallotus philippensis was always male-biased under low light and female-biased under high light regime
irrespective of the kind of overstorey dominance. The structure of Mallotus population was of stable
type under low light regime with greater proportion of trees in communities facing low disturbance.
The distribution of sexually mature individuals was apparently random but close observation suggested
several male and female guilds. The distance between any two adjacent female guilds was, however,
greater than that between any two male guilds. The guilds of opposite sex were, however, farther
than the guilds of same sex. Under low light regime, the size of male guilds in terms of the number of
trees, was greater than the size of female guild as compared to that under fully exposed condition. The
inter-guild distance for any two adjacent female guilds was greater than the same for any two male
guilds. The result has been discussed in the light of ecological significance of sex-ratio and the association
of species within forest vegetation of the region.
