Tropical swamp forests are characterized by relatively low diversity of tree species
which are often believed to be flood tolerant. However, the diverse habitats in which some “swamp”
species, e.g. Callophyllum brasiliense, are found suggest that the trees may not be uniquely adapted to
swamp living. I conducted a series of experiments on seeds and seedlings of common Central American
swamp forest trees. In total, eleven species were used in different germination and seedling survival
experiments. The refuge provided by Pterocarus officinalis buttresses was explored in two short studies.
Germination experiments in the field indicated that seeds of some swamp species (notably Calophyllum
brasiliense, Carapa guianensis, and Prioria copaifera) did not germinate in standing water,
and similarly did not survive six-week periods of submersion as seedlings. In a microtopography study,
overall seedling densities were significantly higher in the elevated refuge provided by Pterocarpus buttresses.
In the absence of adaptations to flooding, other mechanisms might be important in allowing
the establishment and survival of tree species in swamps. Together, the results suggest that although
flood tolerance is strong in some species, flood escape may be the method by which other common species
establish in swamps. Key species like Calohyllum brasiliense, Carapa guianensis and Prioria copaifera
are not flood tolerant but instead utilize a range of flood escape mechanisms to allow their existence
in swamp forests.
