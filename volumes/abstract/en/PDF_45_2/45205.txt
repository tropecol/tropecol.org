An experiment was carried out to study the survival and growth of the nursery seedlings
of Rudraksh (Elaeocarpus ganitrus) transplanted in the forest stands having dense, sparse and open
canopy. The transplants exhibited better growth in terms of shoot length, collar diameter, leaf number
and leaf area and survival in dense than in sparse and open canopy. The pathogen attack on seedlings
was more in open canopy whereas spider webs were more in sparse canopy. The damage by herbivory
was more in open and dense canopy as compared to sparse canopy. Based on the present observations,
it is suggested that plantation of Rudraksh should be raised as understory under the established forests/
plantations with small canopy gaps or in slightly shaded localities for better success.
