The floral syndrome of Zizyphus mauritiana Lamk. (Rhamnaceae) reflects its adaptation
to insects. We examined the blossom visitor assemblage of Z. mauritiana in relation to plant density.
Results indicate that flowers of this plant species are visited by 86 species of insects which consisted
32 species of wasps, 30 flies, 18 butterflies and 6 bees. Pollinators exhibited temporal fluctuations
in their visits. More number of insect species visited the flowers with lower intensities (1 to 10
visits m-2 h-1). It is observed that intensity of pollinators species increases with increased plant density.
Number of pollinators species and their individuals showed significant difference among the blossoms
of three patches of plant density. Similarly, the diversity of pollinators was maximum on dense population
and minimum on isolated plant.
