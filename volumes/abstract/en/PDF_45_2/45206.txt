Peak forests, declared as a National Park, in Diglipur forest division of north
Andaman (13°15' to 13° 41' N and 92° 37' to 93° 7' E) are characterized as humid tropical evergreen forests.
A few species like Aglaia andamanica, Artocarpus gomeziana, Bombax insignie were common in
all the studied sites. Among species, in littoral forests Mimusops littoralis, Artocarpus gomeziana, and
in inland forest Pterocymbium tinctorium, Taberneamontana crispa, were dominant. In foothill forest
Artocarpus chaplasa, Mallotus peltatus (male), were abundant whereas in middle saddle peak forest
area Zanthoxylon budrunga, Parishia insignis and Mesua ferrea were the most abundant species.
Across the sites the population density increased from 459 to 2681 plants per hectare from littoral to
middle saddle peak forest site, but the reverse was true for basal area which decreased from 74 to 48
m2 ha-1. The species richness (61) as well as Shannon Wiener’s diversity index (3.58) were highest in
foothill forest. Beta diversity was maximum in inland forest (5.1) and minimum in middle saddle peak
forest (1.54). Heterogeneity was almost similar in foothill and middle saddle peak forests and it was
relatively less in littoral forest zone. Mean girth showed a decreasing pattern from littoral forest (183)
to middle saddle peak forest (39) similar to basal area. Size variation was greatest in foothill forest site
showing a highest degree of asymmetry. Population structures for different forests have been prepared
and interpreted.
