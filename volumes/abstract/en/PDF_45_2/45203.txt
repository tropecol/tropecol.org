The vegetation and some associated environmental variables were investigated at Key
Afer-Shala Luqa and Southwest of Lake Chamo, in the Gamo Gofa Zone, southern Ethiopia. To determine
the species richness and classify the plant community types, analyze the species richness, evenness and
diversity of the identified plant community types, and relate the plant community types with the
environmental factors, 71 quadrats (size = 20 x 20 m = 400 m2) were sampled at both sites. In each
quadrat, data on the identity and cover abundance of species, altitude, slope and aspect as well as soil
samples were collected. The pH, sand, silt, clay, potassium, sodium and phosphorus contents of the soil
were analyzed in the laboratory. Two hundred sixteen plant species representing 58 families were
recorded. The Fabaceae family was represented by the highest number of species (33 spp. = 15%),
followed by Poaceae (22 spp. = 10%) and Capparidaceae (12 spp. = 7%). Seven plant community types
were identified. Post-hoc comparison of means among the community types showed significant variation
in altitude indicating that altitude was the most important factor in determining community type. The
Hyparrhenia filipendula-Combretum molle dominated community was richer in species and higher in
diversity than others, while the Commiphora cyclophylla-Actiniopteris radiata-Sansevieria ehrenbergii
dominated community exhibited the least species richness and diversity. Recommendations for the
sustainable utilization of the vegetation resources at the study sites are discussed.
