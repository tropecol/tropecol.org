Studies on the changes of hydrobiology due to deposition of sediments in reservoir
of two brackishwater tidal ecosystems viz., Jagannath canal of north Sundarbans and
Mooriganga river of south Sundarbans of West Bengal were conducted to evaluate the suitability
of water of these two ecosystems for shrimp culture. On the second day of sedimentation
in the reservoir, quality of water improved considerably. Dissolved oxygen increased and
chemical oxygen demand and nutrient level decreased in the reservoir in both the areas.
Transparency of water increased by 4.65 folds in north Sundarbans and 2.94 folds in south
Sundarbans area. As a consequence, an average of 112 and 85% increase in gross primary production
was occurred in the above two areas, respectively. Phytoplankton formed a bloom on
the 8-10th day of sedimentation in north Sundarbans only. It is recommended that settled water
of Mooriganga River is more suitable than that of Jagannath canal for shrimp culture and
these waters can be preferably used for aquaculture on 4-6th day of sedimentation in the reservoir.
