The environmental characteristics of Jagannath canal of Sundarbans estuarine
complex of West Bengal monitored during March 1995 to February 1997 showed significant seasonal
variation. Vertical attenuation coefficient of incident light (Kt = 14.41) in the canal was observed
to be influenced by the high load of non-photosynthetic suspended particulate matter
which was highest during monsoon months. Photosynthetic pigment seemed to be of very little
importance. Salinity (0.26-9.54‰) showed an exceptional seasonal pattern with the lowest value
during early winter. The concentrations of different nutrients were found to be considerably
higher and the ratios of different nutrients were highly variable than the normal ratio required
in the aquatic ecosystem. About 93% of the phytoplankton production can be expected from the
ambient concentrations and atomic ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The deteriorating
condition of the system was indicated by the high under saturation of dissolved oxygen, high
chemical oxygen demand and high level of total ammonia preferably in the premonsoon season.
