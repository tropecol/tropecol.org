An inventory of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal status of 28 plant species
belonging to 14 families established on the coastal sand dunes of southwest coast of India was
performed. Roots of 23 plant species were colonized by AM fungi, whereas the rhizosphere of
only 20 plant species possessed AM fungal spores. Canavalia cathartica had the highest root
colonization (83%) by AM, while the rhizosphere of Borreria articularis had the highest number
of AM spores (1.6 g-1). Among 30 AM fungi recovered, Scutellospora erythropa showed a wide
host range (colonized 13 plant species), while Scutellospora gregaria had high spore abundance
per plant species (12.75). The mean species richness on the west coast dunes was 4.4, highest
being in Ipomoea pes-caprae (11). Among the mat-forming creepers, the AM fungal diversity
was highest in Alysicarpus rugosus.
