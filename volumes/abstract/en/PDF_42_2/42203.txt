Relative influence of above- and below-ground competition on the growth and
productivity of Linum usitatissimum (L.) was studied in a Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) De Wit
based alley cropping system at a sub-humid site in central India. To examine the relative impact
of above- and below-ground competition three competition situations were created: Crop +
Leucaena shrub neighbour, Crop + L. hedge neighbour and sole crop in 4 m and 8 m alley-sizes.
Sunlight at ground, soil organic C and total N in soil were measured in all the competition
treatments at different distances from shrub and hedge neighbours. Sunlight did not differ in
crop + hedge treatment compared to that in sole crop plot, whereas, it was reduced by 36 to
82%, across the alley sizes, in crop + shrub treatment compared to that in sole crop plot. Moreover,
reduction in sunlight was greater in 4 m alley. Soil organic C was high but total N was
low in crop + hedge neighbour and crop + shrub neighbour treatments compared to that in sole
crop plot. Growth rate in Leucaena shrub, across the alley – sizes, ranged from 5.6 to 11.8 g m-
2 day-1. Above-ground biomass and grain yield of the crop were reduced by 9 to 37% and 17 to
26%, respectively in crop + hedge treatment and 64 to 98% and 89 to 96%, respectively in crop
+ shrub treatment compared to that of sole crop. Comparing the two competition treatments
(crop + hedge and crop + shrub neighbour) it was observed that above-ground biomass was reduced
to the maximum by 55-60%, growth rate by 42-55% and crop yield by 71-72% due to
above-ground competition. Below-ground competition was 3.6 times greater in 4 m compared
to that in 8 m alley. Intensity of competition ranged, across the alley – sizes, from 0.10 to 0.37
in crop + hedge and from 0.64 to 0.77 in crop + shrub neighbour competition treatment. Intensity
of competition was greater in 4 m alley.
