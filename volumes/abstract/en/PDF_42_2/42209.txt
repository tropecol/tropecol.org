Zooplankton is an economically and ecologically important group of aquatic
animals and their ecological processes influence fishery, oceanography and climate. The present
study attempts to analyse community structure and diversity of zooplankton in Andaman
sea using various richness, diversity and evenness indices and similarity and resemblance
functions. The results showed species richness indices (Margalef and Menhinick) hold good for
zooplankton data. The evenness indices, chord distance and geodesic distance provided realistic
values for analyzing zooplankton community structure hold good for a zooplankton data.
Principal Component analysis being a multivariate eigen analysis provided a better understanding
of community in zooplankton across sites and principal components.
