Spatial and temporal variations in the density and diversity of Diptera were
studied in a temporary pond in Okomu Forest Reserve, southern Nigeria during January 1988
to December 1989. Twenty six morphologically distinct taxa were identified, of which 14 were
chironomids. The dominant taxa were Polypedilum (43%), Alluaudomyia (21%), Culex (11%),
Pentaneura (10%) and Chironomus (5%). The overall density of Diptera differed significantly
(P<0.05) among the four study stations, which were chosen from the bank towards the centre of
the pond, and differentiated mainly by the degree of macrophyte cover, exposure to sunlight
and nature of substratum. Chironomidae dominated at all stations except station 3 where
Ceratopogonidae was dominant. In all stations, the highest densities were recorded in the dry
seasons. There was a significant positive correlation between density and water temperature
and a significant inverse relationship with water level. Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness
were significantly higher (P<0.05) at station 4. Faunal similarity analysis revealed a
strong affinity between dipteran density and aquatic macrophyte cover.
