This paper deals with biomass and net primary productivity of three 7-year old
Casuarina equisetifolia (Forst) stands raised on sodic wasteland. Two regression models (dbh
based and d2H based models) were used to estimate tree biomass. Biomass ranged from 137 to
199 t ha-1 in case of first model; and 135 to 205 t ha-1, in case of second model. There was an
insignificant difference in average stand biomass (170.5-172 t ha-1) by using two different models.
Coefficient of variation showed that component biomass was more variable (CV = 8.5-23%)
in case of d2H based model than that of dbh based model (CV = 5-21%). It, therefore, appears
that use of dbh as an independent variable instead of d2H is an easier and precise method for
biomass estimation. Litterfall in three stands ranged from 5.2 to 7.2 t ha-1 yr-1 (average 6.1 t
ha-1 yr-1) of which leaf litter accounted for 79%. Net primary productivity ranged from 17.9-
19.3 t ha-1 yr-1. The bole wood shared maximum productivity (35%), followed by leaf (27.4%)
and root (15.5%).
