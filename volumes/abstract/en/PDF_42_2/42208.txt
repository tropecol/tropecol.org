The density of Brachyura decapods was estimated in fourteen phytobenthic
communities of the shallow sublittoral region of the coast of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo
States, Brazil. The variation in abundance of these crabs was analyzed relative to the degree
of wave action, size and slope of the rock surfaces and dry weight of the macroalgae. Collections
were done in spring, using 50 x 50 cm quadrats, randomly dropped five times on a transect
10 m long, extended parallel to the water line. Of the twelve Brachyura species identified,
the most frequent and abundant were Pachycheles haigae and Epialtus brasiliensis; these
showed preference for sites with larger abundance of Sargassum spp. or articulated corallines,
respectively. In spite of this, the combined abiotic and biotic data, treated through canonical
correspondence analysis (CANOCO), showed that the differences in the density of the Brachyura
are significant only in relation to the abiotic data, particularly the degree of wave action.
This result indicates that, taking into account the environment as a whole, characteristics
linked to the vegetation are of secondary importance to the epifaunal community, especially
considering motile animals.
