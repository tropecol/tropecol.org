Phenological characteristics of 32 dominant tree species have been studied in
forest ecosystems at Kangchup hills, Manipur (24o45' to 24o51' N latitude and 93o48' to 93o55'
E longitude). The leaf drop, leaf flushing, flower and fruit development in understorey and
overstorey tree species were studied during January 1993 to December 1994. The number of
evergreen tree species were greater than that of deciduous tree species in all the forest sites.
Majority of the species exhibited peak of leaf drop in cool dry period (January-February) and
leaf flushing in the beginning of warm dry period (March-April) and another in rainy season
(August) of the year. Both over and understorey species showed a sharp flowering peak in
April. The peak period of fruit maturation occurred during September-October. Leaf flush and
flowering were simultaneous in both over and understorey tree species whereas the fruiting of
understorey tree species is one month earlier than that of overstorey tree species.
