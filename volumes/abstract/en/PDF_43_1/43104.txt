Forest canopy density is one of the most useful parameters to consider in the
planning and implementation of rehabilitation program. This study is development of biophysical
analysis model for obtaining of Forest Canopy Density (FCD) using LANDSAT TM
data image analysis. The components of FCD model are four factors; vegetation, bare soil,
thermal and shadow. This work is implemented under the research project; PD32/93Rev2(F) of
International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO).
