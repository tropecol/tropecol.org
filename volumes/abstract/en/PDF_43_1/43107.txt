Over exploitation of natural resources for meeting the growing demand for food,
fuel and fodder of ever increasing population, has led to soil degradation of varying degrees resulting
thereby in deterioration of erstwhile healthy ecosystems. Information on the nature, extent,
magnitude and the temporal behaviour of soil degradation is a pre-requisite for taking up
any ameliorative/preventive measures. Space-borne multispectral data by virtue of providing
synoptic view of a fairly large area at regular intervals, offer immense potential for generating
above mentioned information on degraded soils in a timely and cost-effective manner. An attempt
has been made in this article to provide an overview of the utility of space-borne multispectral
data from both indigenous, namely Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1A/1B/-1C/-
1D and/-P3) as well as foreign Earth observation missions like Landsat, SPOT, etc. for assessment
and monitoring of soil degradation; identify gap areas and to project the future scenario.
