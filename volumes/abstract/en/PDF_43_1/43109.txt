This paper reviews the approach and techniques of Remote Sensing (RS)
based crop discrimination and area estimation including single date approach based on
maximum likelihood classification as well as hierarchical/ growth profile for crop classification.
Uniqueness of both optical and microwave data for crop identification in operational
scenario in Rabi and Kharif season is presented. In the past two decades, studies on RS
based crop inventory of more than 20 crops at various spatial scales (village to national) have
been conducted. In most of the studies a sampling-based approach using optimally acquired
single date satellite data and a supervised classifier has been used. More recently, national
scale inventory of wheat and rice using multidate WiFS and Radarsat, Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) data have been carried out. Studies on accuracies of area inventory led to understanding
of effects of sensor characteristics such as spatial, spectral and radiometric resolution
and scene characteristics such as field sizes, acquisition date etc. These experiences in
Crop Area and Production Estimation (CAPE) project over past decade suggests that remote
sensing inventory has matured in operational use. Future perspective such as utilization of
multi-source data and merging techniques, fraction area estimation approaches, as well as
integration of conventional field survey information with remote sensing data towards the
FASAL concept is also presented.
