A large-scale project initiated in the early 1990s, the TREES project, is dedicated
to the development of techniques for global tropical forest cover assessment and for monitoring
deforestation using satellite imagery. The project has developed a reliable method for
global forest change assessment in the humid tropics and has applied this throughout the
world. Twenty-seven local partners from tropical countries contributed to TREES. The approach
is based on a statistical sampling of observation units with a higher sampling rate for
fast changing areas. A pre-stratification was performed using two parameters: “forest cover
area” (from the 1 km resolution maps produced in the first phase of the project) and “deforestation
hot-spot layer” (areas where changes are expected to be higher based on individual expertise).
Forest cover change during the period 1992-1997 was estimated from the one hundred
sample sites using fine spatial resolution satellite imagery.
