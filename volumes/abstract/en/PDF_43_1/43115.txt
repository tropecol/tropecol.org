The complexity and inaccessibility of Himalayan terrain inhibits intensive field
surveys where remote sensing as a tool can help in exploring such ecologically important and
inaccessible areas. The IRS-1C LISS-III data was used to study the forests of Bhagirathi valley
in Uttaranchal. The maps were derived using hybrid approach (a combination of supervised
and unsupervised classification). A total of ten classes were identified. A knowledge-based classification
was used to delineate different conifers, low valley grasslands and scrub from the alpine
regions. This approach uses integration of species distribution pattern and digital elevation
data in GIS domain. Masking and recoding were found useful in removing the noise
caused due to shadows and clouds. Finally a total of eight forests and four non-forest classes
were segregated and mapped. Of the eight vegetation types broadleaved-conifer mixed dominated
the area (24.6%) followed by broadleaved forest (10.5%) whereas the non-forest classes
together accounted for 27.6% of the area. Distribution of vegetation in different altitudinal
zones, aspects and slopes was also analyzed. It was found that in the lowest and highest altitudinal
zones, the forest cover was less compared to middle elevation zone.
