Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies have been
used for gathering the information on physical parameters of the wildlife habitats and geospatial
modeling for wildlife habitat evaluation. The results indicate definite advantage of remote sensing
and GIS over conventional methods. Over time, the availability of better spatial data has
made habitat evaluation and management more scientific and realistic. Many habitat evaluation
procedures based on species-habitat relationship have been worked out. Basically, all models
have tried to evaluate the carrying capacity of the wildlife habitat for a particular animal species.
All models have to be tested for their applicability to real life situations. The accuracy of the spatial
database is positively correlated to the model sensitivity. On cost-coverage analysis, these
techniques have been found to be economical. This paper reviews the developments on wildlife
habitat evaluation and management employing remote sensing and GIS tools.
