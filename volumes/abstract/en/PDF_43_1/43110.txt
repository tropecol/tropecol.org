Traditionally biomass estimation involved harvesting of the trees. As the forest
cover decreased, there became the need for non-destructive methods for volume/biomass estimation.
Methods were developed to relate the biomass with girth, height etc. Component-wise
biomass equations were developed, which were used to estimate biomass at the plot level. In
last couple of years satellite remote sensing has been successfully used for biomass and productivity
estimation. The unique characteristic of plants is displayed by its reflectance in red and
infrared region of electro-magnetic radiation. These have relationship with the biophysical parameters
of plants. Therefore, process based models were developed to make use of the remotely
sensed data available on monthly basis for estimation of Net Primary Productivity
(NPP). Production efficiency model was used to estimate the NPP at the patch level, which
takes Intercepted Photosynthetically Active Radiation (IPAR) and photosynthetic efficiency as
input parameters to estimate NPP.
