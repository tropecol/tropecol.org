Living marine resources represent a wealth of current and future generation in
terms of providing food, economy and recreation to humanity. Ecologically sustainable development
of the marine resources requires that management and use is compatible with the attributes
of exploited resources. This requires crucial knowledge about the natural variability of
marine ecosystem and dynamics of marine living resources in time and space. An attempt was
made here to provide detail information on the state of art of marine resources using remote
sensing data. Availability of high resolution data on both spatial and spectral scale from IRS-
1C/1D and IRS-P4 with their improved sensor like LISS, PAN and OCM provide ample opportunity
to map, monitor and manage the marine resources. Mangroves, corals, wetlands, biodiversity
and productivity of ocean are being mapped and measured on real time using the satellite
data for sustainable development. The basic aim of this review is to have realistic and reliable
information on the potential of marine living resources in Indian Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) and for sustainable development and management. It will also help to augment the seafood
production and thereby the income of the coastal fishing community and fishing industry.
