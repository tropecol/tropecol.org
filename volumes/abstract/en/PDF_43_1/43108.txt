Applications of satellite remote sensing in eco-hydrology are reviewed. Satellite data
have been used to improve rainfall mapping and to monitor relationships between rainfall and
vegetation responses. Spatial patterns of actual evapotranspiration by vegetation associations can
now be calculated using satellite data with a minimum of ground meteorologic data. Vegetation
and inundation dynamics and aspects of water quality of wetlands have been monitored in many
parts of the tropics and elsewhere by using optical multi spectral, thermal and radar images, providing
information for the management of wetlands. Natural vegetation patterns, as observed on
images, can be brought in relation to groundwater occurrences and groundwater flow systems. Inventories
and monitoring of vegetation in watersheds is current practice and multi spectral data is
suited to determine the cover factor in soil erosion studies. New generation of satellites have sensors
to improve accuracies and to develop new applications.
