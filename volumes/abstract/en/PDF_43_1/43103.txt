Forest is a major resource and plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological
balance and environmental setup. Over utilization of forest resource has resulted in its depletion.
The changes in tropical forest cover are matter of global concern due to its ability of promoting
role in carbon cycle. This renewable resource continues to decrease at accelerated rate.
Accurate and timely information in regular interval on the distribution of natural resources on
earth is of top priority for understanding dynamics of the human induced land cover/land use
accelerated changes. This information can be further utilized in understanding biophysical
processes of the earth. In India and the other developing countries it is mostly been lost for the
agricultural practices. Aerospace technology is a potential means of collecting information
about natural resources including forests at any desired time. The technology is considered important
to revise or update available information. The present paper addresses the status of
tropical forest and requirements for its monitoring and assessment. It discusses the potential
of the remote sensing technology for managing the forests, in general and sustaining the pace
of development in this technology. It focuses the technology trends and techniques for tropical
forest assessment at different scale and levels.
