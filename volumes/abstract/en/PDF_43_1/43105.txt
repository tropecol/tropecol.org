India has made tremendous progress in the aerospace technology in the last two
decades. We are one, among the worlds best in satellite and the remote sensing technology. We
are also one of the developing countries facing the natural disasters and trying level best to
mitigate their ill effects. At the best we can minimize their effect. To achieve this, we need to
have a comprehensive management program dealing with mapping and monitoring. The remote
sensing technology with the fieldwork provides an edge to characterize the geomorphologic
aspects. The present paper reviews the application of the remote sensing tools in the application
of geomorphology. A few case studies from the different part of the country are presented
in the context of geomorphology of the foothills of Siwaliks, Central India and the eastern
coast and use of remote sensing.
