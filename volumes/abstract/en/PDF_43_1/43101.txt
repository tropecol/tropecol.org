This paper reviews continental/global land cover mapping projects and their
methodologies with the focus on the Land Cover Working Group (LCWG) / Asian Association on
Remote Sensing (AARS) project which completed its project and is distributing the 30-second

for successful future continental/global land cover mapping.
