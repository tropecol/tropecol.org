Environment is constantly changing as a function of climate and more recently
due to human activities. Timely and accurate monitoring of these changes is a difficult task for
regional planning and management. Up-to-date information on distribution and rate of
changes of any ecosystem are required for a wide variety of applications viz., biome status, environmental,
climatic etc. Aerospace technology has been found to be a vital tool for assessment
and monitoring of these natural resources. The present study focuses on the potential of IRS
1C WiFS data set for the regional level mapping. The temporal resolution along with the recommended
spatial and spectral resolution configures for the assessment of the phenological
growth of the vegetation in the terrestrial ecosystems. The utilization of the climatic data along
with the biogeographic map is proposed to delineate the biomes in the western Indian subcontinent.
The product offers the basic input for the eco-physiological processes for studying the
land surface interactions and conservation strategies of the arid regions.
