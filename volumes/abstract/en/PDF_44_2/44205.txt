According to niche theory, differential use of shared resources facilitates the coexistence
of species in a community. Niche relationships have been studied for a wide variety of
taxa, but such understanding from tropical ungulate assemblies in south-east Asia is lacking.
We investigated habitat relationships in an assembly of four wild ungulates viz., chital (Axis
axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and chinkara (Gazella bennetti)
from western India, using Discriminant Analysis. Ecological similarity between the four
species was analysed in terms of 20 variables and the two cervids were found to use similar
habitat features and the two bovids formed an analogous group. These two groups or “guilds”
differentiated from each other in terms of vegetation structure as the cervids selected for Anogeissus-
Grewia forest community while the bovids occupied Acacia-Butea scrub community.
Habitat-use overlap between the two bovids appeared unstable in the light of theoretical aspects
of population dynamics of interacting species. However, there is scope to achieve stable
coexistence by differentiating over alternate resource axes like food.
