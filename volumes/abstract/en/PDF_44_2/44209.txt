In Dass area of Bauchi state Northern Nigeria we studied the infection rates,
intensity and clinical manifestations of human filarial infections. After an initial census, 1,638
persons who presented themselves were physically examined from a total population of 53.213.
Two hundred and fifteen (20.3%) of 1059 males and 99 (19.1%) of 569 females examined had filarial
infections. Overall, 314 (19.2%) persons were infected. Microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus,
Wuchereria bancrofti, Mansonella streptocerca, Loa loa and Mansonella oerstans were encountered.
Altogether, human filariasis varied significantly among communities, sex, ages and
various occupational categories (P<0.05). While infections with O. volvulus increased with increasing
host age; L. loa infections decreased with increase in host age with no clear trend in
the age-related prevalence of mansonelliasis due to M. streptocerca. Females of reproductive
age had low W. bancrofti microfilaraemia. The prevalence of ocular lesion, lizard skin, onchocercal
blindness and skin depigmentation are linearly related to the intensity of O. volvulus infection
as measured by a low Community Microfilarial Load (CMFL) of 6.0. Blood filarial parasites
showed a low CMFL of 4.8. A close association was noticed between blood microfilaraemia
and mean mf-density in various age groups (r=0.78, P<0.05). The need to implement well
planned intervention schemes involving community mobilization, health education and mass
treatment with ivermectin (Mectizan®) are discussed.
