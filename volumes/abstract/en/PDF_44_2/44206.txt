Rock outcrops occur commonly throughout the Brazilian shield region of eastern
Bolivia. These outcrops represent a unique habitat within a matrix of forest vegetation that increase
regional plant diversity and may also be important for many wildlife species. Surveys of
mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian species on an outcrop in a tropical dry forest in eastern
Bolivia were conducted during an 18-month period to determine the abundance and composition
of wildlife that use rock outcrops. A total of 956 individuals of 95 species were observed.
The most common species observed during diurnal surveys were Pyrrhura molinae, Cebus
apella and Tropidurus torquatus. Birds of the family Caprimulgidae all had high relative
abundances and frequencies on the rock outcrop during nocturnal surveys. The most common
bats captured in mist nets were Platyrrhinus dorsalis and Tadarida brasiliensis. The most
common species captured using small mammal traps was Thrichomys apereiodes, which appears
to be an outcrop specialist. Other probable outcrop specialists include the lizard T. torquatus,
and the nocturnal gecko Homonota horrida. Wildlife was attracted to the rock outcrop
for a variety of reasons including nocturnal heat retention, diurnal thermal uplift, water-filled
concavities, and various food sources common on or near rock outcrops.
