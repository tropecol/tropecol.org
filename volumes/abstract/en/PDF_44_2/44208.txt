A study was conducted to assess the regeneration pattern and species diversity
of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi in shifting cultivated abandoned land (jhum
fallow) and natural forest soils of Arunachal Pradesh, North-Eastern India. The jhum fallow
contained lower VAM fungal population and number of species than the natural forest. A total
of 44 VAM species belonging to six genera namely Acaulospora, Enterophospora, Gigaspora,
Glomus, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora were recorded from soils of jhum fallow and natural
forest sites. Ten species of VAM fungi were found eliminated from the jhum fallow revealing
that the shifting cultivation in the humid tropical soils causes reduction of VAM fungal species.
The indices of dominance and general diversity of VAM fungi in the jhum fallow (0.16 and 0.85)
and the natural forest (0.13 and 0.99) revealed lower species diversity and dominance of by few
VAM fungi species in the jhum fallow whereas species diversity was higher and species
dominance was shared by more VAM fungi in the natural forest site. The decreased diversity of
VAM fungi species in jhum fallow might be due to (i) repeated slash-and-burn agriculture in
the past destroying the VAM fungi propagules, (ii) loss of host plants and (iii) unfavourable
edaphic conditions for regeneration of VAM fungi in the jhum fallow land.
