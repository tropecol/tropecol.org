Earthworm population dynamics was studied in a cultivated soil at Shantipuri
(29o 55' N and 79o 40' E, altitude 233 m) in central Himalayan tarai. A total of 2111 earthworms
from 235 samples were collected. Six species of earthworms were found: one Lumbricidae,
and five Megascolecidae. Densities ranged from 0 to 19.0 ind. m-2 and biomass from 0 to
10.9 g m-2. About 94% of the total earthworms and 94% of the total biomass were found in the
0-10 cm soil layer. Age structure of earthworms indicated that clitellates were more abundant
than aclitellates during the wet periods (June-October). The average annual ratio of clitellates
to aclitellates was 1:0.8. Earthworm density showed positive correlations between soil moisture
and worm biomass.
