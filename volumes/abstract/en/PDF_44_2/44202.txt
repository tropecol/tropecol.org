Soil nutrients and microbial C, N and P were determined at two soil depths (0-
15 and 15-30 cm) in no-input, traditionally weeded and unweeded wet-paddy fields in the
humid tropics of Arunachal Pradesh, northeastern India. Soil nutrients and microbial C, N and
P were greater in the top 0-15 cm soil layer. Microbial C increased after ploughing during late
March and decreased during rainy season. The contribution of microbial nutrients to the soil
nutrient pool was in the following order: Microbial P > Microbial C > Microbial N. Lowest
microbial P values were recorded during crop harvest. Negative correlation between microbial
N and soil inorganic N envisage conservation of mineral N within microbial biomass. Soil
organic C and microbial C were greater in traditionally weeded paddy fields. This suggests that
microbial biomass had a significant role to play in conservation of soil N and P in the stressed
ecosystems such as unweeded and moderately weeded paddy fields. This is also substantiated
by the greater concentration of microbial N to soil total N and microbial P to soil P.
