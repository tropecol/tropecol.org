The chemical composition of the cuticle of two closely related detritivorous
polydesmid millipedes, inhabitants of contrasting forest habitats, was compared for their
respective bioelement content (calcium, magnesium, potassium, silicon). No differences were
found for the absolute amount of bioelements, but the relative amount was higher in
Pycnotropis tida (Diplopoda, Polydesmida, Aphelidesmidae) from the inundation forest. P.
sigma from the upland forest had a higher weight and higher fraction of organic compounds.
That might be explained by a substitution of calcium with proteins. Both millipede species
strongly accumulated calcium, so that differences in calcium contents of the different trophic
levels were reduced within the food chain. The calcium ratio (calcium content in the cuticle to
calcium content in wood) was about 50 in P. tida and 120 in P. sigma. Some adaptive and
evolutionary consequences of the different life cycles in relation to the resource quality and
species distribution are discussed.
