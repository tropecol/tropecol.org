litter dynamic processes (retention, transportation and decomposition)
were quantified in three different hydraulic habitats (riffle, run and pool) in a tropical deciduous
forest stream of Sirumalai Hill (10o 27' N & 77o 29' E), South India. Total number of leaves
per unit area, number of leaves retained by each habitat and litter retention coefficients were
highest in pools, lowest in runs and intermediate in riffles. Leaf litter and total detrital dry
weights were highest in pools and riffles respectively. One way ANOVA revealed significant effect
of habitat types on all selected parameters except leaf litter dry weight. All selected hydraulic
parameters vary significantly between habitat types particularly depth and water current.
Quantitative data suggested that selected hydraulic factors (depth, water current and
substrate heterogeneity) associated with habitat type strongly influence litter dynamic processes
in the selected tropical forest stream.
