Both in a biophysical sense and in terms of the human dimensions of the problems,
mountains form a highly heterogeneous landscape. Largely occupied by traditional societies,
those living close to nature and natural resources, these mountain societies are linked to
the natural forest ecosystem and the human-managed agroecosystems through biodiversity
driven traditional ecological knowledge. This knowledge base operates at varied levels of ecosystem
complexity – sub-specific/species levels going right up to the landscape level complexity.
This paper analyses the special features of this socio-ecological system complexity and considers
various possibilities for sustainable management of natural resources, with concerns for
sustainable livelihood of mountain communities.
