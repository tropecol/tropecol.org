The structural complementarity, in time and space, of private cultivated resources
and public or common uncultivated resources is an important characteristic of Indian
agrarian systems. The contribution of natural resources and uncultivated lands for the food security
of rural populations and for the economic viability of a vast majority of agricultural
farms should be taken into consideration for understanding the present and future stakes in
Indian agriculture. Recent rehabilitation, actually and figuratively, of the social, juridical and
technical engineering capacities of local population, i.e., ethno-sciences, in resources management
appears to favour the emergence of a “post-modern” vision for resource management, by
empowering communities, with a shift in the power balance by readjusting the global vision
conveyed by the State.
