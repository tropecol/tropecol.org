The paper has looked at traditional systems of forestry and agricultural system
management in the central himalayan region. Based on a detailed analysis of traditional ecological
knowledge that is linked with biodiversity, natural and human-managed, various possibilities
for sustainable management of natural resources, with concerns for sustainable livelihood
of local communities have been explored for the Garhwal region in the central himalayas.
It is concluded that if the development interests of local people are marginalized for a long period
of time, they might adopt actions detrimental to the goal of conservation. Capitalizing on
the positive dimensions of traditional knowledge and overcoming its negative dimensions
through conventional science-based inputs could ease the difficult process of securing people’s
participation in environmental conservation together with the socio-economic development of
local communities.
