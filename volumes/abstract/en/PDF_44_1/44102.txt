Nearly all of the research on sustainable development to date focuses on the local
and regional scales. The objective of this paper is to explore the global-scale aspects of the
sustainable development question. By any definition of sustainability, the global life support
system must be maintained within a range of variability in which human societies can continue
to develop and flourish. The phenomenon of global change strongly suggests that human
societies can no longer take for granted that their life support system – the global environment
- will continue to operate within those tolerable limits. Global change research is thus becoming
a key component in providing the knowledge base needed for societies to tackle the sustainability
question at the global scale. The paper presents several examples that show how activities
in one region of the earth have direct implications for sustainable development in others.
