Traditionally, agroforestry is extensively practiced in India, in the form of the
shifting agriculture, a variety of cereal cropping systems, home garden systems, traditional
plantation systems, etc. In recent times, many of these agroforestry systems have started
breaking down for a variety of reasons. In many situations, high diversity based agroforestry
systems have been replaced by low diversity simplified cash crop systems, and this is
questionable in terms of sustainability. The paper argues for traditional ecological knowledge
based approaches linked with provision for multiple value non-wood products. It is concluded
that gaps in the knowledge of multi-purpose trees (MPTs) and systems functioning needs to be
better understood for sustainable agroforestry.
