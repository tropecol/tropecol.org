Growth and development of Joint Forest Management (JFM), as a concept and
its implementation, is assessed in this article to understand the impact of such an exercise on
the development of participatory forestry in India. The article delves with some of the institutional
and policy issues that are being practised. It describes the acceptance of JFM as a forest
management tool and the problems associated with it. The effort has witnessed smoothening of
relation between the Forest Department officials and the community at large, apart from increased
area under forest cover. One of the major concerns of JFM is the lack of transparency
in financial transactions of the forest department and the unilateral powers the forest department
has in deciding the membership to the general body. Though in the recent amendments,
changes were suggested, by and large, the implementing of such suggestions is far from complete.
It suggests some of the policy and structural changes that need to be brought out in view
of the wider acceptability of the JFM.
