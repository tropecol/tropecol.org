This paper gives a brief overview of the research activities of the French Institute
in the field of biodiversity conservation. First, biodiversity-related issues are set in the
global context, while India’s own biological profile is highlighted. Then, the importance of forest
management and policies are expressed, as well as the necessity of a new strategy and action
plans for sustainable conservation and management of biodiversity through an integrative approach
by taking into account ecological, social, economic and institutional aspects. In the wide
field of biodiversity, the French Institute’s research programmes have been focusing for about
four decades on species diversity and ecosystem diversity at the local (i.e. stand and community),
landscape and regional levels. The Institute has been concentrating on plant ecology with
a strong emphasis on trees and forests, from open woodland to dense moist evergreen forests,
considering their present status as well as their long-term history. Geographically speaking,
most of the studies are being carried out in the western ghats and some projects in the eastern
ghats and mangroves. The biodiversity-related activities of the French Institute come under
‘assessment of biodiversity’ and ‘monitoring the dynamics of biodiversity’. Assessment employs
both ecosystem and species oriented approaches and makes comprehensive use of GIS to integrate
them. The monitoring of biodiversity dynamics covers studies on land use and land cover
changes, ecosystem uses and forest products, and forest dynamics itself. Although these longterm
efforts have already been able to put together a sum of knowledge that can help to better
define conservation strategies, more insight is now to be gained on landscape changes linked to
social and economic aspects of forest use and management.
