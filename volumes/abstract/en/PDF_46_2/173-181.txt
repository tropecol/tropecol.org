Establishing effects of land cover change on soil properties have implications for devising land
management strategies for sustainable use. This study appraises the effects of land cover change on soil
properties and two potentially sensitive indicators of short-term soil biochemical changes, namely Nmineralization
and nitrification in a protected grassland and an adjacent agricultural land. The soil of the
agricultural land showed significantly higher soil pH, moisture and mineral–N. The cultivated soil had
significantly higher rate of N-mineralization, nitrification. The change in N transformation rates may be the
result of differences in the nitrifier population and their activity and differences in other soil microbial
community associated with the type of organic matter substrate present in the grassland and agricultural
soil. Land cover change enhanced the rates of N transformation consequently the rate of N loss may also
increase especially in absence of adequate plant cover leading to decrease in soil N content. Therefore,
measures should be taken to reduce conversion of grasslands.
