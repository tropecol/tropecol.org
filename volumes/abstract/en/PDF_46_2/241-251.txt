The present study was conducted in a subtropical humid forest (sacred grove) at
Mawnai, West Khasi hills district of Meghalaya. A total of 133 woody species (92 genera and 48
families) were present. Tree (gbh >15 cm) density (1256±64 individuals ha–1) and basal area (42.8±3.9
m ha ) were markedly high. Species richness index and diversity index were also high, while
dominance index was low. Citrus medica (Rutaceae), the dominant species, was the only species
exhibiting random distribution. All other species showed contagious distribution. Cryptocarya
amygdalina, family Lauraceae, was the co-dominant species. Lauraceae (17 species) was the species
rich family in the grove and exhibited maximum tree density and basal area. However, generic
composition was highest (9 genera) in the case of Euphorbiaceae, which is the co-dominant family in
the grove. Majority of the families were represented by single genus and single species. Log-normal
dominance-distribution curves at the levels of species and family, and wide girth structure signify the
complexity and stability of the community. Density-distribution and population structure of ten
important tree species indicated preponderance of young trees (gbh 15–50 cm) suggesting high
regeneration potential of these tree species.
