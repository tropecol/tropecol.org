A study was carried out in some species of the family Euphorbiaceae namely Actephila excelsa
(Dalz.) Muell.–Arg., Blachia calycina Benth. B. reflexa Benth., B. umbellate (Willd.) Baill. and Phyllanthus
macraei Muell. – Arg. in Tirunelveli hills of southern western ghats to highlight the importance of
intraspecific variation in taxonomic research, by means of phenotypic plasticity. In this present study the
effect of season and altitude on morphological characters are assessed.
