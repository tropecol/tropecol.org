Four species of birds (Carpodacus erythrinus, Passer domesticus, Pycnonotus cafer,
Streptopelia decacto) have been found to feed the ripen fruits of shrub Carissa spinarum (L.) in a
tropical deciduous forest of Chhuhia, Rewa (M.P.). Birds usually swallowed whole fruit and voided
seeds either by regurgitation (P. domesticus) or defecation (C. erythrinus, P. cafer, S. decacto)
beneath the canopy of perching trees and shrubs of the forest. Each frugivore consumed an average
of 4.42 fruits during any foraging bout. The frugivorous birds removed approximately 196 seeds per
day per plant of the shrub within forest. Of the four birds, Pycnonotus cafer, P. asser domesticus and
S. decacto performed much of potential seed dispersal events and proved themselves as principal
dispersers of Carissa spinarum seeds in the Chhuhia forest.
