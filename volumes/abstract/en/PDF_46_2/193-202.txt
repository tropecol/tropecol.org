Eighty–four species of macrophytes belonging to 73 genera and 34 families were recorded from
the riverine beds of six major rivers (Dwarkeswar, Kansai, Keleghai, Rupnarayan, Shilabati and
Subarnarekha) of South West Bengal from March 2001 to February 2002. Physicochemical parameters of
water and soil of different study sites were estimated. Seasonal distributional patterns of different categories
of vegetation (terrestrial, semiaquatic and aquatic) were studied along with the seasonal fluctuation of major
ecological variables. Result on similarity indices showed that river Rupnarayan considerably differs from
other rivers in terms of species composition and abundance of macrophytes.
