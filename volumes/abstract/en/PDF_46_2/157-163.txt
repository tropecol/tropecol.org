After a severe summer forest fires in 1995 in part of Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary, tree mortality
was quantified during post monsoon season of 1996 and pre-monsoon of 1998. A total of 100 sampling points
were established randomly in severely affected oak forest for vegetation sampling. Tree layer was quantified
in 10 m radius circular plots, while seedlings and saplings of various tree species were counted in 3 m radius
concentric plots. Out of 1944 individuals of different tree species, 677 (34.8%) individuals were found dead.
The mortality was significantly higher than expected in Viburnum cotinifolium and Cornus macrophyla and
significantly less than expected in Rhododendron arboreum and Lyonia ovalifolia whereas mortality in other
species was in proportion to their availability. The mortality was significantly higher than expected in < 50
cm girth class. A total of 184 and 382 saplings were counted during 1996 and 1998 respectively while the
corresponding seedling numbers were 465 and 601. The saplings of Quercus leucotrichophora and Lyonia
ovalifolia increased significantly from 1996 to 1998. While among seedlings the number of Quercus
leucotrichophora and Viburnum sp. increased significantly from 1996 to 1998. The post fire species
composition at seedling and sapling stage does not indicate any substantial increase in contribution of Pinus
roxburghii as a consequence of fire. However, change in contribution of other top canopy and understorey
species is expected due to differential regeneration pattern of these species.
