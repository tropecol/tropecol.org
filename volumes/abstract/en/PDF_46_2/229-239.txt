Biomass and productivity in some tropical dry deciduous disturbed teak (Tectona grandis)
forests of Satpura plateau were estimated in three communities identified as Tectona grandis– Lagerstroemia
parviflora–Sterculia urens (site I); T. grandis–Lannea coromandalica–Diospyros melanoxylon–Butea
monosperma (site II); T. grandis–Chloroxylon swietenia–L. parviflora–D. melanoxylon (site III) and a young
plantation of T. grandis (site IV). Disturbance magnitude was determined by estimating density–diameter
relationship and site quality parameters viz. soil nutrients and stand density. Site I and III (also IV) were
most and least disturbed sites, respectively. Height and biomass, and gbh and biomass showed exponential
relationships, thus can used for the estimation of biomass of the region. Trees contributed maximum towards
total biomass followed by herbs and shrubs. Mature sites showed higher biomass than the younger sites.
Photosynthetic:non–photosynthetic ratio was higher for younger and less disturbed sites and can be
attributed to their higher photosynthetic demand at early developmental stages and protection of foliage by
less disturbances from lopping and grazing. Younger stands showed higher values for root:shoot ratios.
Invariably, the NPPtree and NPPtotal were higher for mature stands (reflection of the lesser tree density and
higher mean basal area). NPPtree and NPPtotal under present study were lower than in other tropical dry
forests. This may be the reflection of disturbance on the forests, lower soil depth and poor soil quality. NPPteak
and NEPteak were highest for least (IV) and lowest for most disturbed site (I), indicating the negative effect
of disturbance. This study suggested that plantation of target species in the blanks inside the forest created
by disturbances improves the productivity, and balances the structure of forest ecosystem due to invasion of
local species in due course of time.
