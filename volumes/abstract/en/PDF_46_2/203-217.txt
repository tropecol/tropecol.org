Seeds of Acacia catechu, A. nilotica, Albizia lebbek, Dalbergia sissoo and Tectona grandis from
five provenances of northern India were tested to evaluate the effect of light quality, temperature, substrate
and water-stress on germination of seeds, and to assess the extent of intraspecific variation. Results
indicated that germination of Acacia catechu, A. nilotica and D. sissoo was less dependent on light quality,
whereas direct and far-red light enhanced germination in some provenances of T. grandis and Albizia lebbek,
respectively. Seeds of all the five species exhibited variation regarding the range of optimum temperature
required for maximum germination. Small-sized seeds showed higher germination in paper methods,
whereas germination of medium-sized seeds was higher in sand and soil methods. T. grandis exhibited very
poor results in paper methods. Some provenances of A. nilotica and Albizia lebbek were found to be tolerant
to significantly high levels of water stress. Intraspecific variation in A. lebbek, for temperature requirement
and stress tolerance, was conspicuous.
