To investigate the effects of different land use conditions on the soil seed bank of three crop
fields in a tropical rain forest area of the Los Tuxtlas region in southeastern Mexico (Gulf of Mexico coast), we
compared the number of species, mean seed density and species composition of seeds. The number of species
(33, 45 and 48 species, respectively) was different among fields but mean seed density (total density per field:
10186, 17522 and 33811 seeds m–2) was not different. The crop fields’ seed banks were dominated by
secondary herbs, and few pioneers species and secondary trees were found. Differences in the number of
species and composition are explained on the basis of differences in the surrounding vegetation, the time the
crop fields have been used, management practices and the presence of remnant trees in each field.
