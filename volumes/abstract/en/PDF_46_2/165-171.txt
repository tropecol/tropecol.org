Soil samples were collected from selected arid zones of Rajasthan, India, namely Achrol,
Jaiselmer, Manwar and Pokharan. Studies conducted on the distribution indicated their ubiquitious
occurrence and predominant presence of Nostoc species. Unialgal non-heterocystous forms namely
Phormidium and Oscillatoria and heterocystous forms like Nostoc, Anabaena, Calothrix, Westiellopsis and
Chlorogloeopsis were isolated and purified. These isolates were characterized for chlorophyll content, specific
metabolite content and nitrogen fixing ability. Phormidium species showed maximum chlorophyll
accumulation in comparison to heterocystous forms. Anabaena sphaerica exhibited maximum level of soluble
proteins. Non-heterocystous forms, like Phormidium and Oscillatoria, also accumulated high levels of soluble
proteins. Heterocystous forms namely Nostoc, Anabaena and Westiellopis were more efficient to synthesize
carbohydrates in comparison to nonheterocytstous forms. Anabaena sphaerica, an isolate from Achrol,
showed highest nitrogenase activity. Calothrix species isolated from Manwar and Pokharan region showed
remarkable potential for nitrogen fixation, although these were poor in terms of chlorophyll accumulation
and soluble protein content.
