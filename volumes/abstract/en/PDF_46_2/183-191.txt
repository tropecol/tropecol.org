Sörenson similary index and Coles association coefficient were computed to analyse the
similarity between forest types and association between individual plant species in the Pacchaimalai hills of
the eastern ghats of Tamil Nadu, South India. Sörenson index shows that the higher similarity existed
between the evergreen and semievergreen, the semievergreen and dry mixed deciduous, the dry mixed
deciduous and the dry savannah with the dry deciduous scrub, the southern thorn scrub and the southern
thorn forests. Chi-square values are found to be significant between Santalum album with Dodonaea viscosa;
Cycas circinalis with Cleistanthus collinus, Combretum albidum, Pongamia pinnata and Symphorema
involucratum; Nothopegia colebrookiana with Tarenna asiatica; Pterospermum xylocarpum with Doryopteris
concolor; Smilax zeylanica with Acacia torta; Canarium strictum with Aglaia lawii and Dicliptera cuneata;
Cymbopogon citratus with Grewia hirsuta and G. tiliifolia. This study contributes to the growing body of
evidence suggesting that many species of tropical trees are differentially distributed with respect to habitat
variables, in this case to different forest types.
