Present study deals with quantification of litter production, seasonal variations
in litter nutrient concentration and nutrient return to the forest floor as influenced by insect
defoliation and past disturbances in some tropical dry deciduous teak (Tectona grandis Linn.)
forests of Satpura plateau in Chhindwara forest division in Madhya Pradesh, India. On the
basis of density-diameter relationship of trees, the forest stands were categorised as least
disturbed (site-I) and highly disturbed (site-III). Site-I and III were the most and least
disturbed sites, respectively. Site-II was heavily attacked by teak defoliator (Hyblaea puera
Cram) and skeletonizer (Eutectona machaeralis Walker) that caused premature leaf fall in the
month of September. The magnitude (kg ha-1) of annual leaf fall followed the order: 4149 (II) >
2868 (I) > 2576 (III), while annual litter fall (kg ha-1) followed the order: 4536 (II) > 3305 (I) >
3276 (III). The contribution of leaf litter in total litter fall ranged between 79% (III) – 91% (II)
among the three sites. Site-II which is attacked by insect pest, showed higher contribution of
leaf litter to the total litter fall. The peak leaf and litter fall periods were January and March
for all the sites. Site-II showed bimodal leaf fall pattern due to heavy attack of insect pest.
Concentration of Ca and N were higher than K, Mg and P in all fractions of litter irrespective
of sites. Return of nutrients was in the order: Ca>N>K>Mg>P. The amount of nutrients
returned due to insect pest attack on the trees have implications on the patterns of nutrient
cycling and forest productivity.
