The diversity of plants of ethnoveterinary importance was investigated in southeastern
Nigeria. It was found that indigenous farmers and healers utilize 24 plant species in
the treatment of common livestock ailments such as diarrhoea, ecto- and endoparasitic infections,
retained placenta and dehydration among others. Methods of preparation and administration
were found to include direct feeding of the plant parts, drenching with aqueous decoction
or direct external application of plant juice on the affected parts. It was concluded that efforts
on the development of cheaper veterinary services and imputes in the region should focus
more on the abundant indigenous resources such as flora and culture.
