A dam was constructed in 1994 at the headwaters of the Ibiekuma stream to
provide treated drinking water for the Ambrose Alli University community and its environs.
Changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the stream after impoundment were
investigated between February and August 1995. Three stations (two within the dam site and
one downstream of the dam) were identified for this study along a 3 km stretch of the upper
reaches of the First order stream. Only water level, flow velocity, transparency and dissolved
oxygen were significantly different (P<0.05) among the study stations. The interstation comparison
of parameters using Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that water level, flow velocity,
transparency and dissolved oxygen were significantly different (P<0.05). Dissolved oxygen content
of the pool stations at the dam site were similar but significantly lower than that of the
lotic station. Variability Coefficients revealed two patterns: (1) low variability in all the stations
for temperature, water level, total suspended solid and pH; (2) high variability in all the
stations for the other parameters. The fluctuations in the physical and chemical hydrology of
the stream appear to be influenced by the changes in the fluvial dynamics of the stream due to
impoundment.
