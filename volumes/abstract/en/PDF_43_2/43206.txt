of tree growth, mortality and recruitment in four permanent plots of
tropical wet evergreen forest in Kolli hills of the eastern ghats, India, were investigated between
1996 and 1999. Permanent tree plots of 2 ha (200 m x 100 m) were established in four
evergreen forest sites- Perumakkai shola (PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS)
and Mottukadu shola (MS) along an elevational and disturbance gradient. A total of 3814 trees
=30 cm girth at breast height from 78 species and 36 families were enumerated. There was no
change in species richness during the study period. Mean stand basal area increased by 4.1 %.
Basal area increment was maximum in the highly disturbed site MS and minimum in the relatively
undisturbed site PS (11.6% and 1.7% respectively). Range of growth variation in species
increased with forest disturbance and conspecifics exhibited variation within and across sites.
Mortality was independent of tree size. Mortality rates exceeded recruitment rates and the
stand turnover time was calculated to be 136 years.
