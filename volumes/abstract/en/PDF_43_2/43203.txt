Commonly occurring pteridophytes from two sites namely Mollem and Chorlem
located in western ghats region of Goa were selected for the present study. All the pteridophytic
species examined during the study, exhibited the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal association.
The highest arbuscular mycorrhizal root colonization (75%) was recorded in Pityrogramma
calomelanos whereas the highest spore density (155 spores 100 g-1 rhizosphere soil)
was recorded in Adiantum lunulatum. A fairly good diversity of AM fungi was observed in the
rhizosphere of pteridophytes of this region. A total of 17 AM fungal species belonging to five
genera namely Acaulospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora were recorded.
