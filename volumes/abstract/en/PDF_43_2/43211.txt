study was made on the foot hill, slope (middle hill) and top of the
protected and unprotected hills of the Aravalli at Jaipur (26o 49'N, 75o 48'E, 436 m.s.l.).
Herbaceous vegetation was therophytic in nature, exhibiting maximum number of species
during rainy season. The biomass of herbaceous vegetation at the unprotected hill sites (264-
462 g m-2) was higher than protected hill sites (201-338 g m-2). Annual net primary production
was: protected hill, 430-587 g m-2; unprotected hill, 283-613 g m-2. Nitrogen and phosphorus
contents in the plant biomass varied from 2725-7723 mg m-2 and 364-795 mg m-2 respectively.
The present study revealed an increase in the soil nutrients and species diversity at the
protected hill and role of herbaceous vegetation in the conservation of nutrients at both hills.
