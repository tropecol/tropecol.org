Alpine and subalpine regions of Garhwal Himalaya were surveyed
quantitatively for the population study to determine the status of three aconites viz., Aconitum
balfourii, A. heterophyllum and A. violaceum. Population data of these three aconites revealed
that they are restricted to specific pockets and had very low population density. Illegal and
over exploitation of these species pose threat to their existence. However, to assign the
categories of threats population status of aconites has not been quantified so far. Present study
summarizes the population dynamics of identified aconite species in Garhwal Himalaya.
Observations reveal that on the basis of population density and degree of constancy
(occurrence) used to assign threat categories, all the three Aconitum species are endangered.
Furthermore, these observations would be helpful in monitoring the threat categories in future
on the basis of population reduction.
