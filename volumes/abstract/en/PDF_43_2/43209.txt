In this study, monthly changes in concentrations of various nutrients (N, P, K,
Ca & Mg) and their uptake, accumulation, transfer and release in both plant parts and soil
were studied in grasses grown under Albizzia plantation and in the open grazing land in the
semi-arid region of Madurai. At both sites, the maximum concentration of all nutrients were
recorded in the live shoot, followed by dead shoot, below ground and litter. The average nutrient
accumulation in the plant parts as well as in the soil was in the order of N>K>Ca>Mg>P.
Among the sites, the nutrients concentration in plant components and the uptake from the soil
were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the plantation site than in the open grazing land. The soil
moisture content also showed significant increase under Albizzia plantation than in the open
grazingland. Of the total uptake about 80% of nutrients, were transferred to above ground
plant parts and very little was transferred to below ground parts. At both sites, the nutrients
return to the soil through root was lower than that of litter disappearance. The study reveals
that Albizzia trees can increase the nutrient content of understorey grasses by their rapid leaf
turnover and decomposition of nutrient rich litter, which can result in significant increase in
soil fertility.
