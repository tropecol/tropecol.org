A study was conducted in a Himlayan moist temperate forest in Mandal to identify
the patterns of seed germination and major germination syndromes operating in the forest
and to understand the role of primary selective factors in controlling germination in the plant
community and how groups of species respond to such factors. The germination pattern was
bimodal with the peak time of emergence in June followed by February-March. Along the altitudinal
gradient (1650 to 2600 masl), the maximum number of seedlings emerging per transect
was at the middle elevations of which more than 80% was understorey species while in the
higher elevations canopy tree species seemed to dominate in the regeneration transect. The
mean length of dormancy (MLD) of species recorded in field nursery trials in Mandal ranged
from 10 days to 285 days. Seasonal analysis of the germination pattern revealed that maximum
number of species dispersed their seeds during dry season (Oct-Jan) as compared to rainy
or pre-rainy season. Three germination groups: delayed-rainy (DR), intermediate-dry (ID) and
rapid-rainy (RR) were identified as the major germination syndromes in the study area. Among
the four ecological groupings of species, the season of seed dispersal and dispersal type explained
most of the variance, in MLD among species. The synchronization in the pattern of
emergence within species and between species in Mandal forest was best illustrated by the pattern
of seedling emergence in the four oak species (Quercus semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, Q.
leucotrichophora and Q. glauca) and four under storey species (Euonymus tingens, Symplocos
paniculata, Lindera pulcherrima and Sarcococca hookerana).
