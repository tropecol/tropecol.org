The infestation of Quercus floribunda trees by Taxillus vestitus is common in
Himalaya. Seasonal gas exchange and water relations of T. vestitus and its host Q. floribunda
were studied under natural field conditions in Nainital, Indian Central Himalaya. Leaf water
potential and leaf conductance were followed through the growing seasons on T. vestitus and
infested Q. floribunda. Consistent with the reports elsewhere for other species of mistletoe, T.
vestitus frequently transpires more rapidly than its host, and maintains a more negative water
potential. Predawn and midday water potentials for Q. floribunda are in the range of -0.9
(Rainy season) to -12.3 (Summer season) and -4.4 (Rainy season) to -20.5 (Summer season)
bars, respectively where as for that of mistletoe, it is -1.6 (Rainy season) to -14.9 (Summer season)
bars and -5.9 (Rainy season) to -25.2 (Summer season) bars, respectively during predawn
and midday. A gap in water potential between host and mistletoe occurred throughout the
study period, which increased with the severity of moisture. During all seasons T. vestitus out
transpired the host. It appears that the low water potential enables the mistletoe to have access
to host water all the time and higher transpiration further enhances water uptake and
hence possible intake of valuable elements for growth. Both the species studied showed
stomatal control during the dry season, which seems to be determined by the increase of the
evaporative demand.
