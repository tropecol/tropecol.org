Soil characteristics and microbial activity of vegetated coal mine spoil land
under plantations of five exotic tree species were assessed. The data obtained were
compared with those of the bare overburden mine spoil and the native forest soils. The
results showed an improved soil status under different plantation stands compared to bare
overburden. The silt and clay particles in soil were higher among different plantation
stands in comparison to bare overburden dump. Bulk density was highest in the plots of
Casuarina equisetifolia and lowest in Gravellia pteridifolia plots. Soil moisture content
was also higher under different plantations. Water holding capacity and soil moisture
content were highest in the Eucalyptus hybrid plots. Organic carbon and total nitrogen
concentrations were higher in the plantation stands in comparison to the bare overburden
dumps. Available nitrogen (NO3 – N and NH4 – N) was highest in the plots of Eucalyptus
hybrid in all the three seasons. Soil microbial biomass C, N and P were highest in the plots
of Gravellia pteridifolia and lowest in Cassia siamea plots. The plantations enhanced the
nutrient status of the degraded mine spoil land. The plant species varied in their ability to
modify the soil properties of mine spoil. Among the tree species Eucalyptus hybrid, Acacia
auriculiformis and Casuarina equisetifolia were found to be most suitable for the
modification of spoil characteristics during the revegetation process.
