The influence of forest site manipulations (loosening soil, weeding and removing
topsoil) and forest light environment on emergence of seedlings of selected pioneer, canopy and
understorey tree species were assessed in Kalinzu Forest in areas with different management
histories. The species were Craterispermum laurinum, Funtumia africana, Musanga leoerrerae,
Parinari excelsa, Strombosia scheffleri and Trema orientalis. Most seedlings (> 38 %)
emerged where the soil was loosened and least (< 10 %) in the undisturbed plots. With the
exception of the pioneer species (T. orientalis and M. orientalis), seedlings of other species
emerged in all the manipulated plots. Seedlings of the pioneer species only emerged in plots
with light intensity =90 % while those of the canopy and sub-canopy species (P. excelsa, F.
africana and S. scheffleri) emerged in plots where light intensity ranged from 6 % to 100 %.
