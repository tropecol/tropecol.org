This study attempted to break the seed coat dormancy of Acacia nilotica, a
riverine tree species, by simulating natural conditions. The effects of extended water
soaking, soil burial and shade placement on seeds and pods were studied. Pods, clean-seeds
and unclean-seeds were soaked in water for periods up to 24 weeks in two sites with or
without forest soil. The seeds were sampled for germination every 3 weeks. The results
showed that factors similar to that of the natural habitat had significant effect in breaking
the seed dormancy. The length of soaking period of seeds in water was the most critical
factor. Germination increased with the length of soaking time up to 18 weeks and then
decreased. The 18 weeks is close to the average length of natural flooding period. Water
treatment of seeds was suggested as alternative for the sulfuric acid treatment, which is
expensive and hazardous.
