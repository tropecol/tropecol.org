series of events occur starting from the process of flowering up to the
development of mature forest vegetation in the dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia. Given
time, the mature forest vegetation undergoes a series of changes, which are prompted by
different types of disturbances. In response to these disturbances, succession is triggered in
which different plants use varying strategies to regenerate themselves. The objective of this
paper is to present the second part of an overview of the available information on seed and
regeneration ecology in dry Afromontane forests (DAF) of Ethiopia. The review focuses on
forest disturbances and succession, i.e. types of disturbances; species richness, densities,
spatial distribution of soil seed banks and succession in cleared, cultivated and abandoned
DAF; forest fire and response of plant communities to fire; and regeneration of native woody
plants in tree plantations established after clearing DAF or after clearing DAF and planting of
crops. Thematic areas for future research are recommended.
