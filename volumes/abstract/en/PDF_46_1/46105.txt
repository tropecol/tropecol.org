The nature and the magnitude of the soil seed bank of tropical semi-deciduous
forests at Sigiriya, Sri Lanka were examined in 41 experimental plots established along a
chronosequence of forest age to reveal the potential role of the soil seed banks in forest
regeneration and succession following a large-scale disturbance. Species composition and
abundance in the soil seed banks were influenced by the time of the year and the structure of
forests where the latter is highly determined by the age of forests after a large-scale
disturbance. Clumping of seeds in the soil seed bank was commonly seen in all studied forests.
Soil seed banks of young successional forests were dominated by agricultural weeds, and their
seeds were mainly dispersed by wind. Therefore, such seed banks do not often contribute to the
forest regeneration. After about 20 years, the diversity of the soil seed bank increased and the
seed banks contained some forest tree and shrub seeds. Since the microclimate of such forests
are more favourable for seed germination and seedling establishment, seeds which reach these
forests might germinate and establish well, contributing to successful forest regeneration and
succession. Seed bank of mature forests contain less number of seeds but are also dominated
with grass and agricultural weed species. Therefore, these seed banks cannot support the
natural regeneration of tropical semi-deciduous forests after a large-scale disturbance.
Instead, seeds of grass and agricultural weed species would germinate and establish if a
disturbance occurs. Therefore, such forests are under a threat of degeneration with frequent
disturbances.
