Tree condition and characteristics of natural regeneration of tree species was
assessed in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Sampling was done in anthropogenically
undisturbed, lightly disturbed, heavily disturbed and completely disturbed forest types. Nested
plots measuring 25 x 30 m were established to assess tree size classes from seedlings (diameter
< 2 cm and height = 150 cm) to large trees (DBH > 15 cm). Higher stem densities were found in
undisturbed and lightly disturbed forest types compared to heavily or completely disturbed
types. Tree species richness and diversity were highest in lightly disturbed forest. Acacia
mearnsii, an introduced tree species in Uganda, was recorded in completely disturbed forest.
Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was highest in disturbed sites while regeneration from
seeds was highest in undisturbed sites. High intensity human disturbance was associated with
fewer signs of mammal damage. Damage to trees by physical agents and climber abundance
increased with intensity of disturbance except in completely disturbed forest. High intensity
human disturbance adversely affected tree species abundance, diversity and regeneration and
increased the incidence of damage to trees. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was most
important in heavily disturbed sites. Intensity of disturbance and slope influenced the
distribution of regenerating tree species.
