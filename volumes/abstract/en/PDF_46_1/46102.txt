This review includes data on classes of seed dormancy, or of nondormancy, for
2040 species of trees in climax tropical forests: evergreen, 1098; semievergreen, 515; deciduous,
133; savanna, 223; and montane, 71. In evergreen, semievergreen, deciduous, savanna, and
montane forests, 57.3, 52.0, 34.8, 37.8, and 33.8% of the species, respectively, had nondormant
seeds. Overall, there was an increase in dormancy with decreases in temperature and
precipitation across the gradient of forest types from evergreen to montane forests, but
deciduous, savanna, and montane forests had about the same proportion of species with
dormant seeds. Depending on the family, there were increases, decreases, or no change in
proportion of species with dormant seeds across the gradient. Considering only the species
with dormant seeds, physiological dormancy decreased from evergreen to deciduous forests but
increased slightly in savanna and montane forests. On the other hand, physical dormancy
increased from evergreen to savanna forests but decreased in the montane. Morphological
dormancy decreased from evergreen to savanna forests but increased in montane forests.
Morphophysiological dormancy decreased from evergreen to deciduous forests but increased in
savanna and montane forests. Combinational dormancy (physical + physiological), which
never exceeded 2%, was found only in evergreen and montane forests. Much research remains
to be done to understand the evolutionary origins and biogeography of seed dormancy in
tropical trees, and it is suggested that working on members of plant families that occur across
the gradient of forest types may be a rewarding approach.
