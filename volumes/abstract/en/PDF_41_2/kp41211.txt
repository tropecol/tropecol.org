In the present investigation the leaf litter of eighteen dominant tree species of Nokrek biosphere reserve, Meghalaya, were studied for their natural chemical reserves and physical characteristics. The litter of most of the tree species had carbon content between 34.2% and 49.5%. The ash content varied from 2.2% to 24.0%. Leaf litter of almost all the spe-cies showed the dominance of divalent cations (Ca++ and Mg++) over monovalent (Na+ and K+). Nitrogen and phosphorus contents ranged 1.6 - 2.7% and 0.34 - 0.62%, respectively. Further, the impact leaf litter addition of selected species on soil physico-chemical properties was eva-luated. The higher dose of leaf litter to soil was found to be more effective in improving soil properties than the lower dose.
