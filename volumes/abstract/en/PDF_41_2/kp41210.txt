The algal flora in the salt-affected aridisols of Rohtak, a semi-arid region in Haryana was studied. The soil showed a gradient of salinity with electrical conductiv-ity (EC) ranging from 0.4 to 21 dSm-1 in the rainy season and algal patches consisting of 20 species were recorded in the microquadrats. There were 9 species of cyanobacteria, 8 species of chlorophyceae and 3 species of bacillariophyceae. Oscillatoria was the most frequently found species followed by Anabaena and Closterium. The site with high alka-linity and low salinity (pH 8.9, EC 2.4 dSm-1) showed the maximum number of algal spe-cies (12). In aridisols with higher EC level (8.9 to 21 dSm-1) the algal species were re-stricted to only 4-6. The indigenous cyanobacterial strains from these soils were further studied for evaluating their range of halotolerance using artificially salinized Fogg's Cul-ture medium. Four heterocystous species viz. Anabaena sp. Nostoc commune, Cylindros-permum stangale and Hapalsiphon welwitschii, and three non-heterocytous species, namely, Spirulina, Oscillatoria and Chroococcus turgidus tolerated salt stress upto EC 12 dSm-1. Algal density in the soil of the study site was significantly less in dry season (5 x 102 g-1 soil) than in rainy season (12 x 103 g-1 soil). When exposed to artificial salt stress in culture medium algal growth in both the seasons was maximum at EC 8, fol-lowed by that at EC 12 dSm-1.
