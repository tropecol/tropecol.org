Foraging pattern of birds in thorn forest was studied in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary in 1995 and 1996 during January to April (dry spell) as most of the birds start breeding during this period, demands for energy are greatest and birds spend most of their time in foraging. This study examines the foraging pattern of birds in a 10 ha plot laid in the thorn forest. Information on foraging height, substrate, and method was collected. In total, 1386 observations were made on the above said three dimension for 33 species of birds. Clus-ter analysis of these three dimension shows that the most important factor dividing the bird community into foraging guilds related to the physical structure of the habitat followed by the foraging substrates and methods. In total, nine foraging heights, six foraging substrates, and nine foraging methods were identified for the bird species present in the study plot. All the birds overlapped considerably with other species at least in any one of the three dimensions. Niche overlap was observed high in the usage of height followed by foraging substrate and me-thod. As the birds are evolved with special morphological adaptations to use particular forag-ing method and exploit particular substrate, overlap was less and specialization was more among birds in these two dimensions.
