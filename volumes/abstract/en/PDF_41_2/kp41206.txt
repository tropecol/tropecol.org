Sixty-four species of Rotifers, belonging to 15 families and 26 genera, are rec-orded from five flood-plain lakes of the Brahmaputra river basin, Upper Assam (N.E. India). The examined taxocoenosis depicted general tropical character and indicated various biogeo-graphically interesting, acidophilic and warm-stenothermal elements. The rotifer communities of the different lakes registered 37.3 - 68.9% similarities and their individual species richness ranged between 24 - 35 species.
