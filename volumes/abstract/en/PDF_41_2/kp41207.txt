Studies on guinea worm infections was undertaken between January and Au-gust, 1999 in seventeen villages of Isieke Community in Ebonyi L.G.A. of Ebonyi State, Nige-ria. Of the 6,177 persons examined 416 (6.73%) had active cases of guinea worm while 4503 (72.0%) persons had ever been infected. Fever (70.9%) and severe pain (51.4%) were their pre-dominant presenting symptoms. Disability associated with guinea worm infections in the area include crippling effect, lowered sexual activity and poor maternal attention (in females). Of the 416 active guinea worm cases, 204 (7.0%) and 212 (6.50%) were males and females respec-tively. Over 85% of all infected persons were within the first five decades of life. Ninety-three percentage of all the active cases emerged from the limbs. Infection varied significantly among different villages, age groups and occupational groups (P<0.05). Guinea worm infections in re-lation to sex and religion was independent (P>0.05). Infections in the area depend on the source of water supply. Pond water users recorded more infections than bore-hole/well users. Over 60% of persons examined, filtered their water before drinking. The roles of the Nigerian Guinea Worm Eradication Progamme, Global 2000 and the endemic communities towards the final eradication of the disease in Ebonyi State are highlighted.
