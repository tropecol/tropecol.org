The movements of Neurothemis tullia (Drury) (Odonata: Libellulidae) adults were studied in a rain fed rice field using the mark-release-recapture technique. Both male and female dragonflies were widely distributed within their home range of approximately 30 m radii. Adult movements were highly localized and the longest distance travelled was about 130 m. Diurnal feeding pattern was studied by examining gut contents. Some individuals had tak-en preys as early as 0730 hr. Feeding activity however, peaked at 1030 hr and at 1730 hr. Dai-ly food intake was highly variable between sexes and within hours of the day. Females fed more actively in the morning and their body weights were heavier than that of males at all hours of the day. Active feeding activity of both sexes reflected effective predation.
