The study was conducted in semi arid region, at Rajkot in Gujarat, India. The observations were recorded on free grazing indigenous goats of Zalabadi breed. Time spent in various activities during day from 08 to 18 hours was recorded in different seasons. The en-tries for grazing, walking, standing and sitting activities were made at every five minutes in-terval. Out of the available time in the field, goats spent 62.4% time for grazing, 19.2% for sit-ting, 10.6% in standing and 7.8% in walking. Goats in their grazing activities as well as in fo-rage selectivity pattern exhibited marked diurnal periodicity. There were two peaks for the grazing, one in morning and the other in the evening. The evening peak was more pronounced than morning one. More number of plant categories were grazed in morning than in evening hours. The plant species preferred in morning were different than the plant species in evening.
