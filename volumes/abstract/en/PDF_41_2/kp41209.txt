The colonial system and territoriality of Philidris (Formicidae; Dolichoderinae) ants occupying dominantly epiphytic myrmecophytes, Hydnophytum moseleyanum (Rubiaceae: Hydnophytinae), in a mangrove forest in Papua New Guinea were investigated using a test measuring ant aggressiveness. One ant colony occupied several H. moseleyanum plants on plural mangrove trees. The ants were polydomous and monogynous as the colonies always had a single queen. It was suggested that the arboreal ant fauna in the mangrove forest canopy re-vealed an ant mosaic distribution pattern. As the main food resource, the Philidris ants ob-tained honeydew secreted by the diaspidid scale insects on the shoot tips of the host mangrove trees of H. moseleyanum.
