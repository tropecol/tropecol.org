Changes in concentration of nutrients of rice straw during decomposition in re-lation to soil microarthropod densities were studied across tillage treatments over the seasons in a semi-arid tropical alfisol sorghum ecosystem. The total N content of the straw increased under shallow tillage while the available K, Mg and Ca increased in zero tillage. Tillage and the interaction of tillage and the duration of decomposition significantly affected the concentra-tions of available K and Mg of the straw (P <0.01). The population densities of microarthro-pods explained upto 41% variation in total N and 63% variation in available K concentration of decaying straw in the mesh bags (P <0.05).
