Multiple-stemmed trees are a characteristic feature of Caribbean dry forests. In a semi-deciduous forest stand in Guánica Forest, Puerto Rico, 43.3% of all trees have multiple stems. These multiple-stemmed trees account for 58.0% of total basal area. Ten of eleven common species examined had examples of multiple-stemmed individuals, varying between 13.9% and 80.8% of all individuals for a given species. The presence of multiple-stemmed trees with intact (unharvested) main stems, and the occurrence of multiple-stemmed trees too small to have been subject to cutting prior to forest protection, suggest that the multiple-stemmed condition may arise in the absence of human influence. Natural mechanisms that can promote a multiple-stemmed growth form are discussed.
