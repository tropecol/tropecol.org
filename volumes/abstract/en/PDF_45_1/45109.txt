The stomatal conductance of leaves for water vapor as a function of the intercellular
CO2 concentration and irradiance intensity and soil moisture was investigated for three
species of trees and shrubs at their natural habitats in South America: a seasonal tropical rainforest,
a tropical dry forest, and a savanna of the Campo Cerrado type. The maximum stomatal
conductance of the species from humid environments (rain forest and Campo Cerrado) was
higher than that of the species from the dry forest. For all three species the stomata closed
with increasing intercellular CO2 concentration. At high levels of intercellular CO2 the stomata
did not close completely if the soil was water saturated and the irradiance was high. At ambient
CO2 concentrations the stomata were not fully open even under favorable light and soil water
conditions. Lowering the external CO2 concentration to values of the last glacial maximum
increased the stomatal conductance beyond that for present-day values. The sensitivity of
stomatal closure to an intercellular CO2 increase was fairly similar for the two species from the
rain forest and the dry forest, but was higher for the species from the Campo Cerrado.
