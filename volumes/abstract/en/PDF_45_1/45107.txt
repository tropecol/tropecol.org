We measured the abundance of 15N in herbaceous and woody plants and superficial
soils of savannas in central and eastern Venezuela to assess the contribution of associative
N2 fixation to total plant N accumulation. In plants tissues we measured also the ureide content
as an independent estimation of N2-fixing activity. Soils showed always positive d15N values
(averaging 2.8 to 5.2‰). Legumes had on average significantly more negative d15N values
(-0.8 to -1.2 ‰ against 2.4 to 3.1‰) and significantly higher N concentration than non-legumes
leaf tissues. The relative abundance of ureides was high in legume species with negative d15N
values. Trachypogon spp. showed highly variable, frequently negative, d15N values (0.6 ± 1.4
‰), indicating an occasional significant contribution of N2-fixing bacteria associated with roots.
On the contrary, Cyperaceae species measured had always relatively high positive d15N values
(6.3 ± 1.7 ‰). 15N- and ureid abundance allowed identification of plants with associative N2-
fixation.
