Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) has commonly been estimated as
about 120 Gt C year-1, based mainly on estimates from the International Biological Program
(IBP, 1964-74, with 60 Gt C year-1 for net primary production, NPP) and an assumption that
autotrophic respiration (RA) is about the same as NPP. This 2 x NPP assumption for GPP has
been reinforced by some more recent studies that scaled up from short-term, temperate-zone
site measurements using satellite data, with values of photosynthetic efficiency assumed to be
constant. Analysis of the full IBP data-base suggests higher GPP and RA site values, especially
in the tropics, and higher values for terrestrial totals and the global RA/GPP ratio. The CO2
source-sink behavior of terrestrial vegetation is determined largely by this ratio, and a larger
ratio implies possibly larger biospheric CO2 sources under global warming but also possibly
greater net CO2 uptake by early-successional vegetation. On the other hand, the IBP data
have been discredited by both improved methods for estimating respiration in the field and by
better understanding of the nature and determinants of maintenance versus growth respiration.
Examination of this new respiration paradigm, plus two studies by other authors, suggests
that terrestrial GPP probably is higher than 120 Gt C year-1, though not as high as the
IBP data imply. The IBP data represent the largest, most geographically representative database
available for stand metabolism, so it is perhaps useful to ask just how bad these data are,
where and why, and whether they can be “rehabilitated” in any useful way. The largest uncertainty
appears to be in the tropics, where landscape degradation is often severe and rehabilitation
inherently difficult. Further study should focus on such critical needs, including better
tropical metabolic data and methods for rehabilitating devastated tropical landscapes.
