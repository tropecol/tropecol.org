We showed that malic enzyme and F-type ATPase isolated from glycophytes and
halophytes do not differ significantly in their amino acid composition. Isolated enzymes from
both types of plants showed nearly identical salt sensitivity, each, but enzyme activities in
fresh homogenates from halophyte leaves apparently were more salt resistant as compared to
the ones from glycophytes. These results suggest that some cytosolic compounds other than the
tested enzymes bring about salt tolerance. We observed distinct differences in photosynthate
export out of the chloroplasts when comparing salt stress response of glycophytes and halophytes.
In contrast to glycophytes metabolite leakage out of the chloroplasts or internal metabolite
pool size are more strictly regulated in halophytes. Pronounced differences were observed,
when measuring P-type ATPase activities at the plasmalemma. Apparently, most of the
difference between salt tolerant plants (halophytes) and glycophytes is due to a faster and more
effective response of the former bringing about ion homeostasis by adaptation of transmembrane
transport to saline conditions and coordination of metabolism.
