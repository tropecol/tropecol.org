Based on the great success the senior author had in Japan and other places in
SE Asia, the two authors started similar activities in the Brasilian Amazon lowland cities. In
order to demonstrate to the concerned citizens and to the youth, experiments were undertaken
in which one could demonstrate how the population in general could assist the reforestation of
the largely threatened tropical forest. Two kinds of experiments were carried out to demonstrate
the reforestation with native trees from the Amazon lowland tropical forest. In one experiment,
small numbers of species that could be identified as representing the potential natural
vegetation (PNV) were planted. In the other experiment, many kinds of species including
fast -growing pioneers were planted. After 9 years, we measured tree height and DBH in both
experimental forests and compared species composition, stand volume, tree density and species
diversity. The results suggested that inclusion of pioneer tree species in the planting did not
result in earlier biomass accumulation and increasing more rapidly species diversity.
