Crithmum maritimum is a perennial Apiaceae growing naturally in rocky coasts.
The oil extracted from its seeds seems to be convenient for human consumption. Physiological aspects
of its salt response were studied in a laboratory with NaCl concentration ranging from 0 to
300 mM. The results show that C. maritimum is a facultative halophyte, since it does not require
salt for maximal growth. Fifty percent reduction in shoot DW, leaf surface area and leaf number
were observed at 150 mM NaCl, indicating that C. maritimum is moderately tolerant to NaCl. Culture
in the presence of NaCl led to large accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in leaf tissues, without significant
change in leaf water content. Thus, C. maritimum seemed to be able to sequester salt in leaf
cells for osmotic adjustment. Indeed, the mean salt concentration in leaf tissue water was always
higher than medium osmolarity. Growth was limited mainly by salt-induced decrease in the number
of leaves. Biomass production per unit of leaf surface area was diminished only at highest salt
concentrations. The presence of NaCl in the medium imposed a strong restriction in nutrient (K+
and Ca2+) acquisition, which was due to inhibition of both root intrinsic performance for ion transport
and root growth. In summary, salinity restricts C. maritimum growth through limitation of
mineral nutrient acquisition, rather than osmotic and ionic deleterious effects.
