Plant species diversity and composition of life form categories were recorded in a
tropical dry forest in northwestern Costa Rica. Nine pairs of spatially separated plots were
described representing each of different ages of secondary regeneration ranging from recently
cleared and burned to more than 50 years of regrowth. All vascular plants species encountered
were recorded during 30 months. The results document great changes in species diversity and
composition of plant form categories during sylvigenesis. 328 plant species in 79 families and
247 genera of grasses, herbs, shrubs, lianas and trees were encountered. Species richness was
greatest after 15 years and decreased significantly in older plots. The number of non-woody
species was highest after three years of succession. Minimum of woody plant species was after
one year and increased significantly after five years. Maximum was in the 15 years plots with a
slight decrease in older forests.
