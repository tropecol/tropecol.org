Generation of ecological information about the rare and endangered species is the prerequisite for their conservation. „Gugal? (Commiphora wightii), overexploited for various medicinal and cosmetic use-values, is one of the threatened plants of Indian arid regions, with very little ecological knowledge. This paper examines its abundance, distribution pattern and associations with different species in coastal side of Kachchh district of Gujarat State. During this study, 286 circular plots of 0.1 ha size were sampled where all the woody plants were counted and the main habitat characteristics recorded. Spatial variation in the abundance of C. wightii was clearly evident within the area. Topography, soil type, soil depth and biotic pressures were found as the major controlling factors. A positive association was recorded with species like Acacia nilotica, Acacia senegal and Euphorbia nivullia, while, negative association was recorded with Cassia auriculata. The study reveals that Prosopis juliflora - an exotic weed, has no influence on the abundance of C. wightii. As one of the few conservation meas-ures, study recommends the establishment of small reserves in the north-eastern part of the study area.
