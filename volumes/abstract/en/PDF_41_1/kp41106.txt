A study was carried out on a medicinal herb Acalypha indica Linn. (Family : Euphorbiaceae) in deciduous forest of Alagar hill, South India (12o18? N and 76o42? E) to assess the effect of season (summer and monsoon) and altitude (275, 350 and 550 m above mean sea level) on six morphological parameters. Growth performance of A. indica in terms of number of leaves per plant and shoot height was better during monsoon than the summer season. Simi-larly its best growth was recorded on hill top (550 m) than at mid hill (350 m) and foot hill (275 m). One way ANOVA revealed significant effect of altitude on all growth parameters.
