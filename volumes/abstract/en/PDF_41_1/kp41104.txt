Gradient analysis is used as a research method to investigate species occurrence relative to the complex environmental gradient characteristic of mangrove swamps. Physio-graphic mangrove habitats are sampled using quadrats located along transects established from the water channels inland. Ordination of species importance values along composite ha-bitat transects reveals species modal gradations rather than marked zonation of the species as implied in Clementsian succession theories. Ordination of Pearson’s correlation coefficients be-tween composite quadrats of the habitat transect indicates mostly peaks and dips in the gra-dients, implying that the vegetation and environment are in a state of dynamic equilibrium with each other. There are constant species-environment adjustments and interactions along the gradient and hence an absence of stable conditions in the swamps. Mangroves are perpe-tuated along shorelines as long as their environmental tolerance limits are not exceeded and their growth is optimal relative to the habitat conditions in which they occur.
