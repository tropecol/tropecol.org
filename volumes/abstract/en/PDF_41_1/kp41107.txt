The relationships between several leaf attributes (leaf area, mass, volume, den-sity, thickness, organic matter content, anatomy and leaf specific mass) in two sympatric shrub species, Miconia ibaguensis and M. stenostachya (Melastomataceae), in Brazilian cerrado were explored. Leaf traits were assessed in two environments : a sun-exposed cerrado and in a shaded undestorey riparian forest. Area, mass, density and thickness of the leaves of both spe-cies varied significantly between the two habitats (t-tests, p < 0.05 all). Variations in leaf spe-cific mass were correlated with leaf mass, density, and thickness in both species (Pearson cor-relation, p < 0.001). Fully sun-exposed leaves were denser and thicker due to an increase in the length of the palisade parenchyma cells (M. ibaguensis: sun = 93 ± 3 µm; shade = 61 ± 2 µm; M. stenostachya: sun = 150 ± 5 µm; shade = 92 ± 4 µm). Miconia ibaguensis and M. stenos-tachya presented an increase of 13% and 17% in stomatal density in the sunny habitat, respec-tively. Miconia ibaguensis also showed an increase of 57% in trichome density under high light conditions. These two species showed high leaf structure plasticity in relation to environmen-tal conditions.
