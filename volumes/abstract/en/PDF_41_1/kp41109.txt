Incorporating locally prevalent extractive uses of a natural habitat into valua-tion methods may be appropriate in improving the efficacy and objectivity while justifying pre-servation. The consequences of a change in the marketing structure of medicinal plants caused by forest clearance for a multipurpose hydroelectric project across the river Narmada in the state of Madhya Pradesh was evaluated. Major loss of realizable pharmaceutical value in the submerged zone of a tropical dry deciduous forest upholds the relevance of sustainably ma-naged conservation option over a development option with irreversible changes. Various costs and benefits relevant to the problem are quantified and compared. Multiplicity of benefits and economies of scale associated with in-situ preservation in a local economy offset the net bene-fits projected in the development option mainly due to shortfalls in targeted benefits and com-pensatory afforestation.
