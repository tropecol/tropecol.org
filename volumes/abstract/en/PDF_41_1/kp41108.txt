Attempt has been made for the individual measurement of CO2 fluxes in the Sundarban forest and in the water ways near Jambu Island by using micrometeorological me-thod during 12-13 February 1998. The gas fluxes were measured directly over a short enough time period at variable flux controlling conditions. This environment has been found to be sink for CO2 during study period. A negative linear correlation was obtained between wind speed and CO2 flux from atmosphere to the forest (Faf). The atmosphere to surface water flux (Faw) was found to be due to undersaturated condition of water with respect to solubility of CO2. Measured values for the fluxes of CO2 from the atmosphere to the forest and water areas were found to be at a rate of 24 x 109 and 16 x 106 kg C year-1, respectively.
