The paper reports standing state and cycling of nutrients (N, P, & K) in burnt and unburnt Heteropogon contortus grazingland of Garhwal Himalaya. More nutrients were found in living plant parts than standing dead and litter. Nitrogen was outrival in above-ground live shoots than roots and reverse was true for phosphorus and potassium. Fire re-duced nitrogen in soil and plant parts and increased phosphorus and potassium contents. Up-take of nitrogen was 0.97 and 1.14 g m-2y-1 on burnt (BG) and unburnt (UG) plots, respectively, and 98.4 and 84.9% nitrogen was released through litter and root decomposition on respective plots. Phosphorus and potassium uptake was more on burnt plot than unburnt one. Uptake of phosphorus was 0.72 and 0.66 g m-2y-1, respectively, on BG and UG plots. Of the total uptake, 90.5 and 83.9% was released in soil via root and litter decomposition. Out of the total uptake of phosphorus (1.56 g m-2-BG; 1.36 g m-2-UG), 22.5 to 40.3% was directed to belowground produc-tion (BNP). Release of potassium through root and litter decomposition was 97.9 and 85.0%, respectively, on BG and UG plots. Burning of vegetation stimulated nutrients use efficiency as compared to protection against burning treatment.
