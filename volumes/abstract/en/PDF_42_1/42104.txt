The Aravalli range diagonally bisects the state of Rajasthan and this oldest Archaean
rock formation is also spread in southern and southeastern Rajasthan. The latter zone
is an conglomeration of Aravallis, Vindhyans and Deccan trap and it has undergone a change
in landuse pattern, from forest to irrigated crop land, during recent years. Studies were taken
up in this biologically interesting hilly tract to investigate the spatial diversity of small mammals
as practically no information exists on this aspect. Small mammals were trapped in 35
habitats at 11 locations during 1997-99 and 386 individuals belonging to 15 species were collected
in 5210 trap days. On an overall basis, the house shrew, Suncus murinus was found to
be the most abundant small mammal in all habitats at all localities. Another commensal
mammal, the house rat, Rattus rattus predominated in crop fields along with the mesic species
like Millardia meltada, Golunda ellioti and Bandicota bengalensis. However, the typical
faunistic element of hills, the rock rat, Cremnomys cutchicus occurred in low numbers in the
Vindhyan scrap and Deccan trap due to presence of cracks and crevices which are its preferred
ecological niche. Six mice species preferred the Vindhyan scrap as 62 per cent of them occurred
in this rock formation. Among the four rock types, Aravallis, Vindhyan scrap, Vindhyan plains
and Deccan trap; the Vindhyans were the most occupied as well as species rich rock type.
Among the habitats, cropfields and scrubland were most diversified (a diversity 3.17 and 2.66
respectively) and species rich habitats. The impact of transformation of forests into irrigated
crop field is evident due to a significantly higher frequency of occurrence of commensal small
mammals in croplands apparently due to relatively superior soil moisture regime, food resource
and shelter.
