Following the title page, an abstract
not exceeding 150 words and typed on a separate
sheet should be placed. The text language abstract
should be immediately followed by abstracts in the
other three languages (in alphabetical order) used
in the journal. If the authors can not translate the
abstract in other languages they must include
three more copies of the abstract page with title of
the paper and author’s name which shall be translated
by the Editors.
