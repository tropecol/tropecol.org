More than two third tree species were in early succession and similarly, the
higher number of shrubs and herbs were in early and mid-succession indicates the successional
nature of the community. A comparatively higher number of trees and shrubs were recorded
on the western aspect where low erosion and greater anthropogenic pressure were present.
The total tree density was higher at hilltop of eastern aspect and hill slope of western aspect.
Total tree basal area varied from 4.5 m2ha-1 (hill base) to 11.9 m2ha-1 (hilltop) on the eastern
aspect and from 9.3 m2ha-1 (hilltop) to 16.8 m2ha-1 (hill base) on the western aspect. The sapling
and seedling density was lower on western aspect because higher anthropogenic disturbances
may lead the removal of seedlings of most of the tree species. The shrub and herb diversity
was higher on both the aspects as compared to tree diversity because opening of canopy
provides greater opportunity for the recruitment of shrubs and herbs. There were few individuals
of important species in older girth classes and higher numbers in younger girths indicate
the forest is regenerating. The significant presence of Coriaria nepalensis, nonleguminous
nitrogen fixing species, at all the sites seems to help in the restoration of the ecosystem.
