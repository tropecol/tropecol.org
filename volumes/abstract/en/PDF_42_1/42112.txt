Seeds of Quercus semiserrata Roxb. vary widely in weight, and can be classified
into small (<5 g), intermediate (5 to 8 g) and heavy (>8 g) classes. Heavy seeds contain
greater reserves of protein, carbohydrate, lipid and energy than intermediate-weight and
small seeds. Seed weight has a strong effect on germination. Heavy seeds germinate early
and show better germination than small seeds both under laboratory as well as greenhouse
conditions. Further, the seedlings from heavy seeds survive better and yield greater dry
mass than those from small seeds. Of the four substratum microsites tested (above moss
layer, above litter, under litter and above soil surface), maximum germination occurred on
moss. The position under litter produced significantly better results than above litter, but
did not vary in comparison to soil surface. Of the three light regimes tested (90%, 52% and
28% of full light), 52% light resulted in maximum germination, seedling survival and dry
mass production. However, the results between 90% and 28% light did not vary significantly.
An interaction of seed weight, microsite and light appears to lay optimal conditions
for seed germination and early seedling growth.
