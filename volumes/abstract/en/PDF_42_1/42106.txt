The feeding effect of detritivore soil arthropods namely Porcellio laevis (Isopoda:
Crustacea) and Anoplodesmus saussurei (Polydesmida : Diplopoda) could mobilize important
nutrients from decomposing leaf litter under microcosm conditions. Their feeding effect was
compared against the nutrient status of soil and density of soil microarthropod fauna in three
young monoculture plantations of Acacia auriculiformis, Cassia siamea and Shorea robusta.
The arthropods extracted from seasonal field samples using ‘Tullgren’ funnels were identified
up to major taxonomic categories. Microbial decomposition of litter was sufficient to release
potassium into the sand bed of microcosms but significantly high rates of nitrates, calcium and
organic carbon were released by the animal activity. Feeding interaction between the 2 species
had synergistic effect in sequestering the nutrients particularly calcium and nitrates. Slow
rate of feeding by the isopod produced gradual release of calcium and organic carbon but voracious
feeding of the diplopod resulted into high rate of release of all the nutrients. In the afforested
condition, a large population of microarthropods and higher amounts of all the above nutrients
characterized the soil of Cassia plantation. On the contrary, soil of Acacia and Shorea
stands contained less microarthropod density and low nutrient status. Acari predominated
over Collembola in all the sites indicating rapid rate of litter decomposition. The soil under
Cassia trees had uniformly high microarthropod population during all the seasons suggesting
improved ecological conditions. Similarly, high nutrient content in the soil of Cassia plantation,
particularly calcium could be attributed to the functional significance of a rich population
of decomposer arthropods. Leaf litter of Cassia trees is a good organic source for improving the
decomposer arthropod population and nutrient status in afforested soil.
