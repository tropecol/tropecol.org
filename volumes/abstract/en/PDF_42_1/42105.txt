The effects of habitat fragmentation on termite communities and wood decomposition
rates were investigated in subtropical dry forest fragments in the southwestern region
of Puerto Rico. The composition of the termite community and the abundance of individual termite
species were determined in small (<1 ha), medium (1-10 ha), and large (>10 ha) forest
fragments and compared to a relatively undisturbed tract of contiguous dry forest (Guánica
Commonwealth Forest). In a subset of these sites, wood bundles were set out for a period of 1
year in order to estimate rates of wood decomposition. The composition and structure of termite
communities did not differ significantly between the forest fragments and the contiguous
forest site, while rates of wood decomposition for a representative dry forest tree species were
significantly lower in the fragments. These results indicate the problems associated with inferring
the response of an ecosystem process to habitat fragmentation based solely on the response
exhibited by the community of organisms that mediates the process.
