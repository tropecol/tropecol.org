We studied some aspects of the ecology of Kalij Lophura leucomelana and Koklas
Pucrasia macrolopha pheasants in 23 oak patches of Kumaon Himalaya, India from March
1996 to July 1997. Seven hundred and fifty nine man hours of field searches yielded 111 sightings
of the two species (67 groups of Kalij and 44 groups of Koklas). The direct sighting data
were analysed by discriminant function analysis to investigate habitat factors affecting distribution
of Kalij and Koklas. The first two discriminant functions extracted 78.6% and 12.5% of
variance and were associated with gradients of altitude and tree cover respectively. While Kalij
was related to tree cover gradient, Koklas was associated with gradient of altitude. Multiple
regression analysis was performed to develop equations for predicting the abundance of Kalij
and Koklas. Shrub species diversity, herb density and livestock density accounted for 74% of
variation in Kalij abundance while herb species richness, herb species diversity, altitude and
grass species richness accounted for 78% of variation in Koklas abundance. These results are
discussed viz. conservation of these species in Kumaon Himalaya.
