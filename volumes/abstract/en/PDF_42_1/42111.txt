Photosynthetic activity of Jagannath canal, an important component of the
brackishwater ecosystem of Sundarbans in West Bengal was observed to be highly affected by
the attenuation of downwelling radiation. Gross primary production (mg C m-3h-1, of the canal
was limited at the surface and varied from 5.81-22.16 with an average of 13.45. Respiratory
demand (14.24 mg C m-3h-1) was higher than production even in the photic zone. Chlorophyll a
(Chl a) concentration ranged from 3.85-6.22 mg m-3. Chl a specific photosynthetic production
was very low 1.01-4.61 mg C mg chl a-1 h-1) and was observed to be a function of attenuation of
light, temperature and salinity.
