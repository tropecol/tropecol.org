74 plant species belonging to 29 dicot and 4 monocot families were recorded at
the polluted habitats around Sanganer during two seasons (Spring and late Rains). Poaceae
was the most species rich family, having 12 plant species. The plant species richness in laterainy
season was almost double of spring season. Conversely the total density declined (22-
83%) due to toxicity reduction. The values of IVI (103-197) and biomass (320-718 g m-2) for
Cynodon suggested dominance of this species at all the sites in both seasons. The codominants
amongst grasses were Brachiaria (IVI = 75, biomass = 65.7 g m-2) and Paspalum (IVI = 56-65,
biomass = 210-248 g m-2), while amongst forbs they were Croton, Parthenium and Xanthium
(IVI = 21-80, biomass = 91-145 g m-2). Most of the marshy species usually had very low IVI (<5)
and low biomass (0.2-11 g m-2). The biomass values during spring (87-848 g m-2) were relatively
lower than those in the late rainy season (249-1178 g m-2). The composition responses
(density, biomass, IVI) of vegetation at polluted sites are compared with unpolluted sites. Also,
possible effects of pollution are discussed.
