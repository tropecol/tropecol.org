The study investigated the nutrient status and load of pollution for six heavy
metals (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, Pb and Cd) in the sediment of Jagannath canal, which receives municipal
sewage mixed brackishwater from the Bidyadhari river of north Sundarbans, West
Bengal. The concentration of different heavy metals followed the hierarchy: Fe>Mn>Zn>Cu
>Pb>Cd. Pollution load index value (1.71) of heavy metals and its relationship with organic
carbon indicate that considerable quantity of metals has been carried to the canal by the sewage
of Calcutta metropolis. Result of principal component analysis suggests that no collinearity
existed among the studied metals. However, emphasis on the monitoring of Cd should be
preferred because of its alarmingly higher contamination value.
